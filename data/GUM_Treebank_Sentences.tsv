GUM_academic_exposure-1	Introduction
GUM_academic_exposure-2	Research on adult-learned second language (L2) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [1] – [11].
GUM_academic_exposure-3	Of interest here, studies suggest that, despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar, adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [12] – [15].
GUM_academic_exposure-4	However, it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels.
GUM_academic_exposure-5	Crucially, it is also desirable to retain them, even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2.
GUM_academic_exposure-6	In fact, substantial periods (months to years) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon, and may even be the norm [16].
GUM_academic_exposure-7	Such a scenario may be found in different situations, including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [17], [18] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [19].
GUM_academic_exposure-8	In the present study, we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar: that is, whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and / orless native-like neural processes (“use it or lose it” [20]), no such changes, or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and / ormore native-like processing may be observed.
GUM_academic_exposure-9	Additionally, we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training, in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts.
GUM_academic_exposure-10	Previous Research
GUM_academic_exposure-11	We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [17], [18], [21] – [24], all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral (performance) outcomes.
GUM_academic_exposure-12	(Note that we do not consider case studies, purely observational data, or research on L2s acquired by children; for a comprehensive review, see [16]).
GUM_academic_exposure-13	The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure, mainly on general language skills [17], [18], [21], [23], [24], though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [17], [18] or lexical abilities [22], [23].
GUM_academic_exposure-14	These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [17], [18], [22], [23], or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [21], with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [24].
GUM_academic_exposure-15	Across the studies, the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [17], [18], [22], [24] or mixed classroom and immersion training [21], [23], [24].
GUM_academic_exposure-16	The training lasted varying lengths of time, apparently usually in the range of a few years, and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels (though not directly measured, except by [24]) prior to the period of limited exposure.
GUM_academic_exposure-17	Overall, the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following.
GUM_academic_exposure-18	A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition (loss) of L2 performance or knowledge [17], [18], [21], [23].
GUM_academic_exposure-19	Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure, e.g., after a 1 - 7month [23] or 6 month delay [21], as well as after 2 years [18], though in one case it was observed only by 3 - 5years, and not earlier [17].
GUM_academic_exposure-20	Although attrition may take place within the first few years, some studies suggest that it then appears to level off, with no further losses occurring [17], [18].
GUM_academic_exposure-21	Higher levels of proficiency (or exposure) may be associated with less attrition [17], [18], [21], [23] or even with no observed losses [21].
GUM_academic_exposure-22	Moreover, one study found no changes at all in performance, across proficiency levels, after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [22].
GUM_academic_exposure-23	Finally, in some cases a gain in performance has been observed: after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study, particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [24], and in another study after 2 years, though only for some abilities, such as listening and reading comprehension [18].
GUM_academic_exposure-24	It remains unclear what might explain such gains, which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [24], or to factors related to general maturation, cognitive development, or continued academic training [18].
GUM_academic_librarians-1	Digital Humanities Clinics -
GUM_academic_librarians-2	Leading Dutch Librarians into DH
GUM_academic_librarians-3	Michiel Cock m.p.cock@vu.nl Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands
GUM_academic_librarians-4	Lotte Wilms lotte.wilms@kb.nl National Library of the Netherlands, the Netherlands
GUM_academic_librarians-5	In 2015, an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium, based on the example of the American communal space of librarians, archivists, LIS graduate students, and information specialists to discuss topics ‘Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet’.
GUM_academic_librarians-6	At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not (yet) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject.
GUM_academic_librarians-7	On the administrative level, the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries (UKB) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH.
GUM_academic_librarians-8	A year later, the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek), and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field.
GUM_academic_librarians-9	Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians.
GUM_academic_librarians-10	The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries.
GUM_academic_librarians-11	We see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians, but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries.
GUM_academic_librarians-12	In essence, we want to teach our country’s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects.
GUM_academic_librarians-13	The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH, for a diverse group of librarians, consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills.
GUM_academic_librarians-14	The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students, identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and (perhaps) to automate their daily library work.
GUM_academic_librarians-15	We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers, but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects, follow the literature and research, follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community.
GUM_academic_librarians-16	In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud - principle(Williams, 2010):
GUM_academic_librarians-17	Desk research about what being a DH librarian entails (e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al., 2015; Mulligan, 2016; also see the Zotero library of the LIBER Digital Humanities working group);
GUM_academic_librarians-18	Identify possible subjects, based on experience, a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH (e.g. The Programming Historian, the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University's Developing Librarian project) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities;
GUM_academic_librarians-19	Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects, based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need;
GUM_academic_librarians-20	Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects, based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills.
GUM_academic_librarians-21	With these in hand, we will design the curriculum of clinics, based on the method of' constructive alignment' (Biggs et al., 2011), to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching / learningactivities stay aligned.
GUM_academic_librarians-22	Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics, each one full day.
GUM_academic_librarians-23	Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers, that address the conceptual knowledge needed.
GUM_academic_librarians-24	The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible.
GUM_academic_librarians-25	By having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities.
GUM_academic_librarians-26	With these clinics, we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities, making access to support easier for new digital scholars.
GUM_academic_librarians-27	The poster at DH2017 will present the curriculum, its position in the international context and offer the lessons learned from both the design process and the first clinics.
GUM_academic_librarians-28	We welcome discussion about our efforts and the possibilities of applying this in other contexts.
GUM_bio_byron-1	Education and early loves
GUM_bio_byron-2	Byron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School, and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie, in Dulwich. [17]
GUM_bio_byron-3	Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey, he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but not restrain himself from "violent" bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for his deformed foot.
GUM_bio_byron-4	His mother interfered with his studies, often withdrawing him from school, with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected.
GUM_bio_byron-5	In 1801, he was sent to Harrow, where he remained until July 1805. [6]
GUM_bio_byron-6	An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer, he did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's in 1805. [19]
GUM_bio_byron-7	His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise.
GUM_bio_byron-8	Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at school, [6] and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803.
GUM_bio_byron-9	His mother wrote, "He has no indisposition that I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short, the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth." [6]
GUM_bio_byron-10	In Byron's later memoirs, "Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings." [20]
GUM_bio_byron-11	Byron finally returned in January 1804, [6] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys, which he recalled with great vividness: "My school friendships were with me passions (for I was always violent)." [21]
GUM_bio_byron-12	The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare — four years Byron's junior — whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy (1821). [22]
GUM_bio_byron-13	His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships, Childish Recollections (1806), express a prescient "consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him." [23]
GUM_bio_byron-14	Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow, John Thomas Claridge.
GUM_bio_byron-15	John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare
GUM_bio_byron-16	Ah!
GUM_bio_byron-17	Sure some stronger impulse vibrates here, Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear To one, who thus for kindred hearts must roam, And seek abroad, the love denied at home.
GUM_bio_byron-18	The following autumn, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, [24] where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston.
GUM_bio_byron-19	About his "protégé" he wrote, "He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever."
GUM_bio_byron-20	In his memory Byron composed Thyrza, a series of elegies. [25]
GUM_bio_byron-21	In later years, he described the affair as "a violent, though pure love and passion".
GUM_bio_byron-22	This statement, however, needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions (including public hanging) against convicted or even suspected offenders. [26]
GUM_bio_byron-23	The liaison, on the other hand, may well have been "pure" out of respect for Edleston's innocence, in contrast to the (probably) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School. [27]
GUM_bio_byron-24	Byron spent three years at Trinity College, engaging in sexual escapades, boxing, horse riding and gambling. [28]
GUM_bio_byron-25	Also while at Cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse, who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club, which endorsed liberal politics, [28] and Francis Hodgson, a Fellow at King's College, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life.
GUM_bio_emperor-1	Emperor Norton
GUM_bio_emperor-2	Joshua Abraham Norton (c. 1818 – January 8, 1880), known as Emperor Norton, was a citizen of San Francisco, California, who in 1859 proclaimed himself "Norton I, Emperor of the United States".
GUM_bio_emperor-3	He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be "Protector of Mexico" as well.
GUM_bio_emperor-4	Born in England, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa.
GUM_bio_emperor-5	After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848, he sailed west, arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849.
GUM_bio_emperor-6	Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice.
GUM_bio_emperor-7	After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton's public prominence faded.
GUM_bio_emperor-8	He reemerged in September 1859, laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States.
GUM_bio_emperor-9	He had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him;
GUM_bio_emperor-10	nevertheless, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented.
GUM_bio_emperor-11	Though some considered him insane or eccentric, citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland, and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay.
GUM_bio_emperor-12	Long after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube, and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge "The Emperor Norton Bridge".
GUM_bio_emperor-13	On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont (now Grant) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment.
GUM_bio_emperor-14	Nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral.
GUM_bio_emperor-15	Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore, Morris and Goscinny, Selma Lagerlöf, and Neil Gaiman.

GUM_bio_emperor-19	By 1859, Norton had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States.
GUM_bio_emperor-20	On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself "Emperor of these United States":
GUM_bio_emperor-21	At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S.F., Cal., declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U.S.;
GUM_bio_emperor-22	and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of Feb. next, then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity.
GUM_bio_emperor-23	— NORTON I, Emperor of the United States.
GUM_bio_emperor-24	The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin.
GUM_bio_emperor-25	Norton would later add "Protector of Mexico" to this title.
GUM_bio_emperor-26	Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year "reign" over America.
GUM_bio_emperor-27	One of Norton's undated proclamations
GUM_bio_emperor-28	In his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state.
GUM_bio_emperor-29	After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress.
GUM_bio_emperor-30	In it, Norton observed:
GUM_bio_emperor-31	... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice;
GUM_bio_emperor-32	that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects;
GUM_bio_emperor-33	that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.
GUM_bio_emperor-34	Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to "remedy the evil complained of".
GUM_bio_emperor-35	In an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress:
GUM_bio_emperor-36	WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished;
GUM_bio_emperor-37	WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with;
GUM_bio_emperor-38	NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress.
GUM_fiction_beast-1	The Beast
GUM_fiction_beast-2	I was thirteen.
GUM_fiction_beast-3	It was spring, the barren time in March when you can not be sure if it is really warmer, but you are so desperate for change that you tell yourself the mud at the edge of the sidewalk is different from winter mud and you are sure that the smell of wet soil has suddenly a bit of the scent of summer rains, of grass and drowned earthworms.
GUM_fiction_beast-4	And it has, because it is spring and inside the ground something is stirring.
GUM_fiction_beast-5	I was wearing a yellow linen dress which my mother had picked out and which I therefore disliked although I knew it flattered me.
GUM_fiction_beast-6	My shoes were white and I was concentrating on keeping them out of the mud.
GUM_fiction_beast-7	My father and I were going to mass — my mother did not go; she was Protestant.
GUM_fiction_beast-8	My father put his hand on top of my hair, his palm on my head, and I could feel the bone of my skull and my skin and his hot palm, so dry and strong.
GUM_fiction_beast-9	When I was a little girl, he did that often, and called me Muscles.
GUM_fiction_beast-10	He had not called me Muscles or put his hand on my head for a long time.
GUM_fiction_beast-11	I could not help arching my back a little, I wanted to push against his hand like a cat but the instinct that comes with being thirteen, the half-understood caution that makes a girl timid, or wild, the shyness told me to just walk.
GUM_fiction_beast-12	I wanted to feel the rough edge of the pocket of his coat against my cheek, but I was too tall.
GUM_fiction_beast-13	I wanted to be seven again, and safe.
GUM_fiction_beast-14	But I still wanted to push against his hand and put my hand in his pocket and steal the leather palmed glove, that secret animal.
GUM_fiction_beast-15	Instead I went into the church, took a Bulletin, dipped my finger in Holy Water and genuflected.
GUM_fiction_beast-16	The inside of the church smelled like damp wood and furniture polish, not alive at all.
GUM_fiction_beast-17	My father took off his coat and draped it over the edge of the pew and when I came back from communion I stole his glove.
GUM_fiction_beast-18	The paper taste of the wafer was still in my mouth and I took a deep breath of the leather.
GUM_fiction_beast-19	It smelled like March.
GUM_fiction_beast-20	We walked back through the school because it was drizzling, my father tall in his navy suit and my shoes going click on the linoleum.
GUM_fiction_beast-21	There were two classes of each grade, starting at the sixth and going down to the first.
GUM_fiction_beast-22	The hall ended in a T and we went left through the gym, walked underneath the bleachers and stood next to the side door, waiting for the rain to stop.
GUM_fiction_beast-23	It was dark under the bleachers.
GUM_fiction_beast-24	My father was a young man, thirty-five, younger because he liked to be outside, to play softball on Saturday and to take my mother and me camping on vacation.
GUM_fiction_beast-25	He stood rocked back on his heels with his coat thrown over his shoulders and his hands in his pockets.
GUM_fiction_beast-26	I thought of bacon and eggs, toast with peach jam out of the jar.
GUM_fiction_beast-27	I was so hungry.
GUM_fiction_beast-28	The space under the bleachers was secret and dark.
GUM_fiction_beast-29	There were things in the shadows; a metal pail, a mop, rags.
GUM_fiction_beast-30	Next to the door was a tall wrought-iron candle holder — the kind that stood at either end of the altar.
GUM_fiction_beast-31	There was no holder and the end was jagged.
GUM_fiction_beast-32	On the floor was a wrapper from a French Chew.
GUM_fiction_beast-33	They were sold at eighth-grade basketball games on Friday nights.
GUM_fiction_beast-34	The light from the door made the shadows under the bleachers darker, the long space stretched far away.
GUM_fiction_beast-35	I heard the rain and the faint rustle of paper and smelled damp concrete.
GUM_fiction_beast-36	I did not go near my father but kept my hand in my pocket, feeling the soft leather glove.
GUM_fiction_beast-37	There was a rustling on the concrete and the drizzle of soft rain.
GUM_fiction_beast-38	I wondered if anyone ever went back under the bleachers, if there were crickets or mice there.
GUM_fiction_beast-39	The rustling might have been mice.
GUM_fiction_beast-40	I wished the rain would stop.
GUM_fiction_beast-41	I wanted to go home.
GUM_fiction_beast-42	I made noises with my heels but they were too loud so I stopped.
GUM_fiction_beast-43	Something else clicked and I tried to see what it was but couldn’t see anything.
GUM_fiction_beast-44	It wasn’t as loud as my heels.
GUM_fiction_beast-45	My father cleared his throat, looking out the door.
GUM_fiction_beast-46	I imagined a man down there in the dark, an escaped convict or a madman.
GUM_fiction_beast-47	It had nearly stopped raining.
GUM_fiction_beast-48	In fifteen minutes we would be home and my mother would fry eggs.
GUM_fiction_beast-49	I heard a noise like paper.
GUM_fiction_beast-50	My father heard it, too, but he pretended not to, at least he didn’t turn his head.
GUM_fiction_beast-51	And there was a heavier sound, a rasp, like a box pulled over concrete.
GUM_fiction_beast-52	I looked at my father but he didn’t turn his head.
GUM_fiction_beast-53	I wished he would turn his head.
GUM_fiction_beast-54	There was a click again and the rustle, and I could not think of what it could be.
GUM_fiction_beast-55	I had no explanation for the particular combination of sounds.
GUM_fiction_beast-56	No doubt there was, some two things that happened to be making noises at the same time.
GUM_fiction_beast-57	Once in a fever I heard thousands of birds outside my window and I was terrified that they would fling themselves through the glass and attack me, but it was only the rain on the eaves.
GUM_fiction_lunre-1	Chapter Two: Master Lunre
GUM_fiction_lunre-2	My father’s actions were largely incomprehensible to me, guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations.
GUM_fiction_lunre-3	He dwelt in another world, a world of intrigue, bargains, contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island.
GUM_fiction_lunre-4	He was in many ways a world in himself, whole as a sphere.
GUM_fiction_lunre-5	No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes — even the one that prompted him, a patriotic islander, to bring me a tutor from Bain: Master Lunre, an Olondrian.
GUM_fiction_lunre-6	The day began as it usually did when my father was expected home from his travels, the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor.
GUM_fiction_lunre-7	We stood by the gate, washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes, my mother twisting her hands in her skirt, my father’s wife with red eyes.
GUM_fiction_lunre-8	Jom, grown taller and broad in the shoulders, moaned gently to himself, while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones.
GUM_fiction_lunre-9	We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company, but before we saw them we heard the children shouting: “A yellow man!”
GUM_fiction_lunre-10	A yellow man!
GUM_fiction_lunre-11	We glanced at one another in confusion.
GUM_fiction_lunre-12	My mother bit her lower lip; Jom gave a groan of alarm.
GUM_fiction_lunre-13	At first I thought the children meant my father, whose golden skin, the color of the night-monkey’s pelt, was a rarity in the islands; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father, and would never have greeted a council-member with such ill-mannered yells.
GUM_fiction_lunre-14	Then I remembered the only “yellow man” I had ever seen, an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood, who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes, attached to his ears with wires, and roamed the hills of Tinimavet, cutting bits off the trees.
GUM_fiction_lunre-15	I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well-received treatise, On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut, and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree-cuttings.
GUM_fiction_lunre-16	“There they are,” said Pavit, the head house-servant, in a strained voice.
GUM_fiction_lunre-17	And there they were: a chain of riders weaving among the trees.
GUM_fiction_lunre-18	My father’s plaited umbrella appeared, his still, imposing figure, and beside him another man, tall and lean, astride an island mule.
GUM_fiction_lunre-19	The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village, so that they advanced like a festival, drawing people out of their houses.
GUM_fiction_lunre-20	As they approached I saw that my father’s face was shining with pride, and his bearing had in it a new hauteur, like that of the old island kings.
GUM_fiction_lunre-21	The man who rode beside him, looking uncomfortable with his long legs, kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule.
GUM_fiction_lunre-22	He was not yellow, but very pale brown, the color of raw cashews; he had silver hair, worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap.
GUM_fiction_lunre-23	He was not the leaf-collecting doctor, but an altogether strange man, with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine-knuckled hands.
GUM_fiction_lunre-24	As he dismounted in front of the house I heard my mother whispering: “Protect us, God with the Black-and-White Tail, from that which is not of this earth.”
GUM_fiction_lunre-25	My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us, grinning.
GUM_fiction_lunre-26	I thought I caught an odor off him, of fish, sea-sickness and sweat.
GUM_fiction_lunre-27	We knelt and stared down at the bald ground, murmuring ritual greetings, until he touched the tops of our heads with the palm of his fleshy hand.
GUM_fiction_lunre-28	Then we stood, unable to keep from staring at the stranger, who faced us awkwardly, half-smiling, taller than any man there.

GUM_interview_cyclone-4	Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h, as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength?
GUM_interview_cyclone-5	Yes, all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters.
GUM_interview_cyclone-6	Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land, the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate.
GUM_interview_cyclone-7	As of the last advisory, T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland, headed on a northwest track.
GUM_interview_cyclone-8	That is a Category 3 storm.
GUM_interview_cyclone-9	The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours.
GUM_interview_cyclone-10	However, there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path.
GUM_interview_cyclone-11	Yes, it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land.
GUM_interview_cyclone-12	This occurs for two reasons:
GUM_interview_cyclone-13	As it moves over land, it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [which is] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface;
GUM_interview_cyclone-14	Increased friction - the ocean surface is much, much smoother than the land surface.
GUM_interview_cyclone-15	Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat, which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain.
GUM_interview_cyclone-16	As tropical cyclones make landfall, this energy source is cut-off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land.
GUM_interview_cyclone-17	Yes, the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land.
GUM_interview_cyclone-18	Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land.
GUM_interview_cyclone-19	In the mean time, much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength.
GUM_interview_cyclone-20	Yes.
GUM_interview_cyclone-21	All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall.
GUM_interview_cyclone-22	However, they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides, and river flooding.
GUM_interview_cyclone-23	Phailin's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland.
GUM_interview_cyclone-24	Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength.
GUM_interview_cyclone-25	However, and this is important, it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty.

GUM_interview_cyclone-28	A previous cyclone in 1999 in the Bay of Bengal area of India left 10,000 people dead.
GUM_interview_cyclone-29	Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone?
GUM_interview_cyclone-30	I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm.
GUM_interview_cyclone-31	However, historically, there have been several events that should cause a societal response.
GUM_interview_cyclone-32	Hopefully, we all learn from past mistakes.
GUM_interview_cyclone-33	The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable, with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed, millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US$ 10 billion.
GUM_interview_cyclone-34	I don't have enough information to answer this question, one way or the other.
GUM_interview_cyclone-35	From all the press reports that I have read, the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed.
GUM_interview_cyclone-36	The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past.
GUM_interview_cyclone-37	The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate.
GUM_interview_cyclone-38	Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out, which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations.
GUM_interview_cyclone-39	Unfortunately, extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation.
GUM_interview_cyclone-40	My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space.
GUM_interview_cyclone-41	I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history.
GUM_interview_cyclone-42	This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin.
GUM_interview_cyclone-43	I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [...] sponsored by the Indian government.
GUM_interview_cyclone-44	Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region, the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives.
GUM_interview_cyclone-45	I cannot comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone.
GUM_interview_cyclone-46	However, the news reports (BBC etc.) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding.
GUM_interview_cyclone-47	Water is the main killer in these storms.
GUM_interview_cyclone-48	From all reports that I have seen, the government was well prepared for this cyclone.
GUM_interview_cyclone-49	For this question I don't know the 'preparedness' of the Indian gov't to deal with this.
GUM_interview_gaming-1	Wikinews interviews Mario J. Lucero and Isabel Ruiz of Heaven Sent Gaming
GUM_interview_gaming-2	General questions
GUM_interview_gaming-3	What is Heaven Sent Gaming?
GUM_interview_gaming-4	Heaven Sent Gaming is basically me and Isabel, I'm Mario J. Lucero.
GUM_interview_gaming-5	And, I'm Isabel Ruiz.
GUM_interview_gaming-6	And, together we formed this thing, it's sort of like an entertainment team.
GUM_interview_gaming-7	We started it basically, because I wanted to - I wanted to work with Isabel on a lot of projects that we had going on together.
GUM_interview_gaming-8	We were coming with comics, like, left and right, we were coming up with things like Karis, in high school she came up with that one, I came up with an individual story called Thad's World Destruction and, she wanted to illustrate it, and so, that's the way we ended up doing it.
GUM_interview_gaming-9	Yep, we like to just make our own original content, and, yep, that's what we wanted to do.
GUM_interview_gaming-10	How did you two meet?
GUM_interview_gaming-11	We met back in high school.
GUM_interview_gaming-12	In this private, tiny-tiny private school of 50 students.
GUM_interview_gaming-13	But, before hand in middle school, I kept on hearing about this guy named Mario, and he kept on hearing about me, this girl named Isabel.
GUM_interview_gaming-14	And, everyone, all of our friends and all of our acquaintances would say," Hey, you'd get along with him really well."
GUM_interview_gaming-15	So before hand I kinda knew about him, but I never met him.
GUM_interview_gaming-16	And one of our friends, our common friends, he introduced us during study hall, and we just kind of hit it off from there.
GUM_interview_gaming-17	It's true.
GUM_interview_gaming-18	Who else is involved in this project?
GUM_interview_gaming-19	Currently, we 're in talks with people.
GUM_interview_gaming-20	There's Jeff [Drake], who is behind the camera.
GUM_interview_gaming-21	Right now, yeah, he's helping us right now.
GUM_interview_gaming-22	We 're talking about doing some individual web series, video series.
GUM_interview_gaming-23	Josh Kindig, he's coming on board, he has some ideas for that too, he wants to take over "aywv" and do more gaming news.
GUM_interview_gaming-24	There's of course Jason, who is our editor and he's the one who writes dD.
GUM_interview_gaming-25	Digital Domain
GUM_interview_gaming-26	What is your purpose behind this venture?
GUM_interview_gaming-27	Well, back in college, back in Collins College, Isabel and I, we had met like she said at Sandia View Academy, and we went off to college together in Arizona;
GUM_interview_gaming-28	and ... (how do I best explain this?)
GUM_interview_gaming-29	Basically, she came up with a few class projects, and I came up with a few class projects;
GUM_interview_gaming-30	we started working with a few of our friends, and colleagues and whatnot.
GUM_interview_gaming-31	Those included Drew Cass, Devin Thurlow, people like that.
GUM_interview_gaming-32	She had several ideas, and she used to draw a lot in the sketchbook, she used to have this thick sketchbook that she used to carry around with her everywhere, where she'd draw these different characters and whatnot;
GUM_interview_gaming-33	and she was always really shy to show that off to people, and I wanted to help her show that stuff, and I wanted to bring it out to the world.
GUM_interview_gaming-34	I was a writer, and she always liked my writings, so I was like, let's just get both of our things together, and let's get this done.
GUM_interview_gaming-35	And for me, what I want the purpose to be, is to inspire people.
GUM_interview_gaming-36	To bring a little more light to the world is what I want, out of all of this.
GUM_interview_gaming-37	And what was the verse that we have?
GUM_interview_gaming-38	First Corinthians 9: 25?
GUM_interview_gaming-39	Yes.
GUM_interview_gaming-40	Yeah, exactly.
GUM_interview_gaming-41	We just want to be able to bring, like she said, bring light into the entertainment and into the media industry, specifically is what we do.
GUM_interview_gaming-42	Yeah.
GUM_interview_peres-1	The future of the peace process in Israel
GUM_interview_peres-2	"The future is only peace. The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for."
GUM_interview_peres-3	Shimon Peres image: David Shankbone.
GUM_interview_peres-4	Mr. President, as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel, do you still think that there is a future to the peace process?
GUM_interview_peres-5	The future is only peace.
GUM_interview_peres-6	The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for.
GUM_interview_peres-7	Why do I say peace?
GUM_interview_peres-8	Because when you look historically, at the development of humanity, most of our lives we are living on the land.
GUM_interview_peres-9	The history is written with red ink.
GUM_interview_peres-10	The reason for it is because people were fighting for our land, either defending it or extending it, because that was the main source.
GUM_interview_peres-11	The land, the natural resources, the markets, all these go together.
GUM_interview_peres-12	The minute the land was replaced by science, what is there to fight about?
GUM_interview_peres-13	Armies cannot conquer science.
GUM_interview_peres-14	Customs cannot check what a scientist has in his mind, they can see what he has in his pocket but not what he has in his mind so it’s uncontrolled; it means that borders aren’t important and distances aren’t important.
GUM_interview_peres-15	How do you approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when, in the end, they don’t want Israel to exist.
GUM_interview_peres-16	How do you come to an understanding to make peace possible?
GUM_interview_peres-17	Well, what is the problem?
GUM_interview_peres-18	I mean, is the problem national, say between Jews and Arabs; or is it a matter of generations between an old age and a new age?
GUM_interview_peres-19	You see, the terrorists are protesting against modernity.
GUM_interview_peres-20	They think that modernity may endanger their tradition.
GUM_interview_peres-21	They are simply afraid and hate modernity.
GUM_interview_peres-22	They consider modernity as their enemy, but then they have two problems.
GUM_interview_peres-23	First of all, can they exist on tradition?
GUM_interview_peres-24	They cannot.
GUM_interview_peres-25	Sooner or later they will have to enter the new age.
GUM_interview_peres-26	All the talks about nationalities, etcetera, well, the new age has very little patience for history.
GUM_interview_peres-27	History is becoming more and more irrelevant.
GUM_interview_peres-28	How do you feel about that?
GUM_interview_peres-29	Well, I distinguish between two histories, the spiritual and the material.
GUM_interview_peres-30	Or the history of events and the history of values.
GUM_interview_peres-31	The history of values is okay because wisdom is ageless; it doesn’t grow old, like material.
GUM_interview_peres-32	But events are totally unimportant for 2 reasons.
GUM_interview_peres-33	First, the event is unimportant.
GUM_interview_peres-34	Tell me, what events is today important such as how many elephants Hannibal had on the Alps, when you can have helicopters?
GUM_interview_peres-35	Why should I bother my children with all this nonsense?
GUM_interview_peres-36	What sort of a nose did Cleopatra have?
GUM_interview_peres-37	God, I don’t know!
GUM_interview_peres-38	You can invite people to war over noses, but nobody will go to fight for noses any more.
GUM_interview_peres-39	On the other hand, there are already machines that can replace our memory.
GUM_interview_peres-40	Why should I bother my child with memory when he can buy a computer that will remember everything you asked him to remember?
GUM_interview_peres-41	The waning importance of history
GUM_interview_peres-42	Isn’t the answer to that question that wise decisions are made with a basis from memory?
GUM_interview_peres-43	Although a computer can have …
GUM_interview_peres-44	No, no.
GUM_interview_peres-45	Forget memory.
GUM_interview_peres-46	Look, the new age is unprecedented.
GUM_interview_peres-47	When something is unprecedented, it means it doesn’t have a past, doesn’t have a history.
GUM_interview_peres-48	It’s totally oriented on the future.
GUM_interview_peres-49	And whoever dwells in the past, doesn’t understand the future because the past is full of prejudices, of commitments.
GUM_interview_peres-50	It arrests us.
GUM_interview_peres-51	And then you say you won’t commit a mistake, so you’ll commit new mistakes.
GUM_interview_peres-52	It doesn’t matter.
GUM_interview_peres-53	`` I say brains is the greater producer of wealth, not oil.
GUM_interview_peres-54	It’s limitless, and you’ll see that the GNP of Israel is very close to the Saudis’.
GUM_interview_peres-55	So they are 3 times larger than us and they have all the oil in the world.
GUM_interview_peres-56	We have brains."
GUM_interview_peres-57	— Peres, on whether the Arab states' oil wealth will eclipse Israel's prominence in the region.
GUM_interview_peres-58	What about the adage, “Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it”?
GUM_interview_peres-59	So they will make new mistakes.
GUM_interview_peres-60	Mistake is inevitable as long as there are human beings.
GUM_interview_peres-61	But you cannot repeat mistakes because the world is not built on repetition; it’s built on mutation.
GUM_interview_peres-62	Don’t you think Darfur is repetition?
GUM_interview_peres-63	I think Darfur is, again, the last, or among the last battles between old and new.
GUM_interview_peres-64	What are they fighting for?
GUM_interview_peres-65	What are they killing killing killing over?
GUM_interview_peres-66	They don’t carry futures.
GUM_interview_peres-67	It’s not a mistake.
GUM_interview_peres-68	It belongs to a past.
GUM_interview_peres-69	It doesn’t have a moment.
GUM_interview_peres-70	I am sure that the reasons for war are over, even though still there are wars which are an inertia from the past, a continuation that doesn’t make sense.
GUM_interview_peres-71	I’m answering your question.
GUM_interview_peres-72	The problem is how to enable the whole world to enter the new future, including the Arabs.
GUM_interview_peres-73	And there are already Arabs who did it.
GUM_interview_peres-74	Look at Turkey, who is knocking on the doors of the united Europe.
GUM_interview_peres-75	Why?
GUM_interview_peres-76	It’s not a geographic endeavor, it is an intellectual endeavor.
GUM_interview_peres-77	They say you can be Muslim and modern.
GUM_news_defector-1	Scientology defector arrested after attempting to leave organization
GUM_news_defector-2	Saturday, October 9, 2010
GUM_news_defector-3	Recent reports have revealed that a defector from the elite group within Scientology called the Sea Org was first persuaded to travel back to a management building for the organization in California, where he was interrogated by an attorney for Scientology and then arrested.
GUM_news_defector-4	Daniel Montalvo in September 2010, after having left the elite group within Scientology called the Sea Org.
GUM_news_defector-5	Montalvo is holding a copy of the book Blown for Good critical of Scientology, written by Marc Headley.

GUM_news_defector-7	Daniel Montalvo, 19, a member of Scientology all his life, was arrested after leaving its elite group the Sea Org.
GUM_news_defector-8	He was released on US$ 20,000 bail on Thursday.
GUM_news_defector-9	Montalvo was charged with taking hard drives and a zip drive from the Scientology organization after leaving the Sea Org group.
GUM_news_defector-10	The Sea Org requires members to sign a billion-year-contract, agreeing to work for the organization founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard for multiple lifetimes.
GUM_news_defector-11	Members of the Sea Org live a strict lifestyle – with little income, small diet provided and significant time invested in work per day.
GUM_news_defector-12	Montalvo had read an article in the Scientology propaganda publication Freedom Magazine, which attacked high-ranking defectors from the organization including Tom Devocht and Mark Rathbun.
GUM_news_defector-13	Montalvo had known Devocht personally, and came to the conclusion that the claims made about him in the Freedom article were lies.
GUM_news_defector-14	Montalvo was subsequently motivated to seek out information about Scientology on the Internet, and came upon a blog written by Rathbun.
GUM_news_defector-15	Montalvo contacted former members of Scientology, who helped him leave the organization and get in touch with Devocht.
GUM_news_defector-16	He traveled to Florida to meet with Devocht, who had told Montalvo he would assist him with future employment and housing.
GUM_news_defector-17	According to Rathbun the Scientology property in question was returned by mail to the organization by Montalvo shortly after he left the Sea Org.
GUM_news_defector-18	Scientology officials have stated they have not received the materials.
GUM_news_defector-19	After calling the Scientology organization by phone to attempt to speak with his mother, Montalvo was instead put through to a Scientology attorney, Kendrick Moxon.
GUM_news_defector-20	Rathbun wrote, "Moxon proceeded to lie to Daniel that the hard drives were never returned, and made a convincing case (not difficult to do with a 19 year old who does not even know the three branches of government) that Daniel would be put behind iron bars for a good long time, UNLESS of course, he returned and cooperated with Moxon and routed out properly."
GUM_news_defector-21	To "route out" in Scientology jargon refers to the member who wishes to leave proceeding through a set of interrogative exit interviews while attached to the Scientology device called the E-meter.
GUM_news_defector-22	According to Rathbun, a detective for the Los Angeles Sheriff's office was provided with material from Scientology to build a case against Montalvo.
GUM_news_defector-23	Rathbun stated,
GUM_news_defector-24	"Daniel was picked up by an investigator in a black car with blacked out windows.
GUM_news_defector-25	Instead of being taken to a hotel, where he could route out as promised, he was taken to the Century City Towers.
GUM_news_defector-26	He was deposited in an office on the 33rd floor where a pricy church lawyer interrogated him for two hours."
GUM_news_defector-27	Rathbun asserted that Scientology officials, "... plied the Sheriff's detective with a grand conspiracy theory, characterizing me as the 'anti-christ' of the church of Scientology. ... The next thing Daniel knows he's in a cell where he sat for the next 30 hours."
GUM_news_defector-28	Steve Whitmore, a representative for the LA Sheriff's office, told LA Weekly in a statement that the case involving Montalvo was being dealt with as charges relating to grand theft.
GUM_news_defector-29	Whitmore stated Montalvo left Scientology-related employment in Los Angeles on September 24.
GUM_news_defector-30	On September 29, Scientology officials went to the East Los Angeles sheriff's station where they claimed Montalvo allegedly left the organization with computer hard drives.
GUM_news_defector-31	Whitmore told LA Weekly that on October 6 after traveling back from Florida, Montalvo "walked into lobby of the East L.A. station and turned himself in", and told the police, "everything he did".
GUM_news_defector-32	Whitmore stated to LA Weekly that the alleged crime involved five hard drives each of $ 200 in value.
GUM_news_defector-33	Montalvo has been assisted by former members of Scientology, including musician Tiziano Lugli and actor Jason Beghe.
GUM_news_defector-34	Rathbun requested donations via a statement made on his blog, in order to help Montalvo with his legal defense financing.
GUM_news_defector-35	He described Montalvo as an individual, "facing the penitentiary in thanks for the following sins: a) Leaving a lifehood of slavery to get a taste of freedom and the world. b) Refusing - despite every provocation and incentive and threat - to frame three guys who went out of their ways (and dipped into their pockets) to help the kid achieve that freedom."
GUM_news_homeopathic-1	Parents prosecuted after homeopathic treatment leads to daughter's death
GUM_news_homeopathic-2	Friday, May 8, 2009
GUM_news_homeopathic-3	Thomas Sam, 42, and his wife Manju Sam, 36, from Sydney, Australia, are undergoing trial for manslaughter by gross negligence for the death of their nine-month-old child, Gloria.
GUM_news_homeopathic-4	She died from infection caused by severe eczema after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy, a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience.
GUM_news_homeopathic-5	Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals including Social Science & Medicine have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery.
GUM_news_homeopathic-6	An example of severe eczema.
GUM_news_homeopathic-7	Image: Jambula.
GUM_news_homeopathic-8	Gloria developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist.
GUM_news_homeopathic-9	Thomas Sam, a practising homeopath, instead decided to treat his daughter himself.
GUM_news_homeopathic-10	His daughter's condition deteriorated, to the point that the baby spent all her energy battling the infections caused by the constant breaking of the skin, leading to severe malnutrition and, eventually, her death.
GUM_news_homeopathic-11	By the end, Gloria's eczema was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy, and in the words of the Crown prosecutor, Mark Tedeschi, QC, "Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying, irritable, scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother's breast."
GUM_news_homeopathic-12	Gloria also became unable to move her legs.
GUM_news_homeopathic-13	Mr. Tedeschi also told the court that, over the last five months of her life," Gloria's eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other."
GUM_news_homeopathic-14	However, despite their child's severe illness, and her lack of improvement, the Sams continued to shun conventional medical treatment, instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths.
GUM_news_homeopathic-15	Gloria temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments, but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy, and she consistently worsened.
GUM_news_homeopathic-16	Allegedly, Thomas' sister pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor, but he replied "I am not able to do that".
GUM_news_homeopathic-17	The parents are also accused of putting their social life ahead of their child, taking her on a trip to India and leaving her to servants while embarking on a busy social schedule, and giving her homeopathic drops instead of using the prescription creams they had been given.
GUM_news_homeopathic-18	Gloria was finally taken to the emergency department shortly before her death.
GUM_news_homeopathic-19	By this time," her skin was weeping, her body malnourished and her corneas melting", according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
GUM_news_homeopathic-20	Speaking in the parents' defense, Tom Molomby, SC, said that, as the parents came from India, where homeopathy is in common use, they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences.
GUM_news_homeopathic-21	Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that, if given to a healthy person undiluted, would cause symptoms similar to the disease.
GUM_news_homeopathic-22	Typical treatments take the dilutions, with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution, past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain; for homeopathic treatments to work, basic well-understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong.
GUM_news_homeopathic-23	There is no evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebo for any condition.
GUM_news_iodine-1	Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency
GUM_news_iodine-2	Thursday, February 23, 2006
GUM_news_iodine-3	Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say.
GUM_news_iodine-4	A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation.
GUM_news_iodine-5	The report's authors say iodine deficiency is "the sleeper health issue in Australia", and potentially a very serious one.
GUM_news_iodine-6	The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week, revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient.
GUM_news_iodine-7	The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised.
GUM_news_iodine-8	They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders.
GUM_news_iodine-9	A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8 – 10 years, from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, between July 2003 and December 2004.
GUM_news_iodine-10	Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread, is ongoing.
GUM_news_iodine-11	The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population.
GUM_news_iodine-12	They call for "urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia."
GUM_news_iodine-13	Most iodine in food comes from seafood, milk and iodised salt.
GUM_news_iodine-14	Professor Cres Eastman, Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study, and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine.
GUM_news_iodine-15	Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage, stunted growth and deafness.
GUM_news_iodine-16	Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries.
GUM_news_iodine-17	"I suspect they won't do that on a voluntary basis, we've tried so far and haven't succeeded, so we've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised," he said.
GUM_news_iodine-18	The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry, where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers.
GUM_news_iodine-19	Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades, but is now declining.
GUM_news_iodine-20	Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods.
GUM_news_iodine-21	The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods.
GUM_news_iodine-22	Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised.
GUM_news_iodine-23	He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt.
GUM_news_iodine-24	"The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs.
GUM_news_iodine-25	So if we go to the pregnant woman, she doesn't get enough iodine, she won't make enough thyroid hormone, and the foetus won't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain, so you'll then see consequences being loss of IQ, learning difficulties, hearing difficulties and other neurological problems," Professor Eastman said.
GUM_news_iodine-26	"If an infant's not getting enough iodine ... brain development won't be completed and they won't grow normally, and as you get older the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid won't function as well as it should, so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life."
GUM_news_iodine-27	More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency, and yet the problem is easily fixed.
GUM_news_iodine-28	The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt.
GUM_news_iodine-29	The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism, a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life.
GUM_news_iodine-30	WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world’s most prevalent, yet easily preventable, cause of brain damage.
GUM_news_iodine-31	Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found.
GUM_news_iodine-32	"Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis.
GUM_news_iodine-33	So that alarms me, because there's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country," he said.
GUM_news_iodine-34	"If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points, on average.
GUM_news_iodine-35	There shouldn't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia."
GUM_news_iodine-36	Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand, says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year.
GUM_news_iodine-37	She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right.
GUM_news_iodine-38	We need to "make sure there's sufficient iodine added into the food supply, to help those people with a deficiency.
GUM_news_iodine-39	But at the other end of the scale we've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people don't get too much and get overdose," Ms Bauchtman said.
GUM_news_iodine-40	"One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking."
GUM_news_iodine-41	Senior researcher Mu Li, of the University of NSW's school of public health, said "it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient, putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency."
GUM_voyage_athens-1	Athens (Greek: Αθήνα, Athína), is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants.
GUM_voyage_athens-2	It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece, and therefore of Western civilization.
GUM_voyage_athens-3	Understand
GUM_voyage_athens-4	Old Athens
GUM_voyage_athens-5	The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis.
GUM_voyage_athens-6	The legend says that the King of Athens, Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom (c. 1230 BC).
GUM_voyage_athens-7	This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility.
GUM_voyage_athens-8	By the 7th century BC, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code (hence "draconian").
GUM_voyage_athens-9	When this failed, they appointed Solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594).
GUM_voyage_athens-10	This was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes (508 BC).
GUM_voyage_athens-11	During the Middle Ages, Athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under Byzantian rule.
GUM_voyage_athens-12	Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades, actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period.
GUM_voyage_athens-13	However, this fruitful period was short-lived, as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire, only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece.
GUM_voyage_athens-14	Modern Olympic Games
GUM_voyage_athens-15	Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.
GUM_voyage_athens-16	While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike.
GUM_voyage_athens-17	Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics (from new freeways to light rail systems), the city's historic center underwent serious renovation.
GUM_voyage_athens-18	Most notable among the city's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts.
GUM_voyage_athens-19	The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD.
GUM_voyage_athens-20	It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia, but quite interesting.
GUM_voyage_athens-21	Architecture
GUM_voyage_athens-22	Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State.
GUM_voyage_athens-23	Although it had a prestigious past, the city's political, economic, and cultural importance had declined over the centuries, leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times.
GUM_voyage_athens-24	With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens, architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins, with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings, large city squares, green spaces, and wide avenues, making a conscious, decisive turn from the city's Ottoman past.
GUM_voyage_athens-25	The city regained its importance in Greek civilization, and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city, with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation's past.
GUM_voyage_athens-26	The 20th century however, marked the rapid development of Athens.
GUM_voyage_athens-27	The city suffered minor damage during WWII, and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed, as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized.
GUM_voyage_athens-28	In the 1960s and 1970s, many 19th century neoclassical buildings, often small and private, were demolished to make way for office buildings, often designed by great Greek architects.
GUM_voyage_athens-29	The city also expanded outward through rash development, particularly towards the west, as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces.
GUM_voyage_athens-30	With the onset of the automobile, public officials reduced the city's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s.
GUM_voyage_athens-31	By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and, coupled with the country's new found remarkable prosperity, large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades.
GUM_voyage_athens-32	Over the course of the next 15 years, money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects, the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings, the gentrification of the city's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city's coastline.
GUM_voyage_athens-33	The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city.
GUM_voyage_athens-34	Athens today is ever evolving, forging a brand new identity for the 21st century.
GUM_voyage_athens-35	Climate
GUM_voyage_athens-36	Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens.
GUM_voyage_athens-37	Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves, but this rarely happens.
GUM_voyage_athens-38	Winter is definitely low season, with the occasional rainy or snowy day, but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists.
GUM_voyage_athens-39	Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads, on most sunny days the skies are azure blue.
GUM_voyage_athens-40	The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave.
GUM_voyage_athens-41	The government's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin.
GUM_voyage_coron-1	Coron
GUM_voyage_coron-2	Coron is in the province of Palawan, Philippines on Busuanga Island.
GUM_voyage_coron-3	It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations.
GUM_voyage_coron-4	Background
GUM_voyage_coron-5	Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga, and the name of a different, smaller island just offshore.
GUM_voyage_coron-6	The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving, and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world.
GUM_voyage_coron-7	In September 1944, a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy.
GUM_voyage_coron-8	The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef.
GUM_voyage_coron-9	There are also attractions on Coron Island itself.
GUM_voyage_coron-10	There are many beautiful white sand beaches, mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife.
GUM_voyage_coron-11	Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations, and good for snorkeling, and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night.
GUM_voyage_coron-12	History
GUM_voyage_coron-13	The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago.
GUM_voyage_coron-14	They were a nomadic, seafaring people, living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture.
GUM_voyage_coron-15	Although they are now sedentary (with the young using cell phones, etc.), they maintain many of their old customs, traditions and beliefs.
GUM_voyage_coron-16	Today, the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron.
GUM_voyage_coron-17	In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron.
GUM_voyage_coron-18	From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II, the municipality experienced the mining boom.
GUM_voyage_coron-19	Labor shifted from farming to mining.
GUM_voyage_coron-20	In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines.
GUM_voyage_coron-21	On September 24, 1944, a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay.
GUM_voyage_coron-22	To this day, about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world.
GUM_voyage_coron-23	In 1947, large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron, and the town experienced another boom, a fishing boom.
GUM_voyage_coron-24	The population increased, as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners.
GUM_voyage_coron-25	On June 17, 1950, Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954, Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan.
GUM_voyage_coron-26	On September 12, 1992, Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion.
GUM_voyage_coron-27	In the past, Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan.
GUM_voyage_coron-28	It remains a small, quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing, slowly but steadily,
GUM_voyage_coron-29	Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry.
GUM_voyage_coron-30	In the past decade, there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in, making tourism the major industry player in Coron today.

GUM_whow_joke-1	How to Tell a Joke
GUM_whow_joke-2	Two Parts:
GUM_whow_joke-3	Getting the Material Right
GUM_whow_joke-4	Getting the Delivery Right
GUM_whow_joke-5	From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends, a good joke pleases everyone.
GUM_whow_joke-6	Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension, make a new friend, or light up a room.
GUM_whow_joke-7	That is, of course, if you can get a laugh.
GUM_whow_joke-8	Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people, but for others it takes practice and hard work.
GUM_whow_joke-9	Part 1 of 2:
GUM_whow_joke-10	Getting the Material Right
GUM_whow_joke-11	Know your audience.
GUM_whow_joke-12	All aspects of the joke you tell, from the content to the length, need to be suited to your audience.
GUM_whow_joke-13	What’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old - uncle laugh (then again, maybe not).
GUM_whow_joke-14	Everyone’s an individual, so there are no hard and fast rules.
GUM_whow_joke-15	But, unless you personally know the members of your audience, here are some good rules of thumb to follow:
GUM_whow_joke-16	elderly people won’t like crude jokes;
GUM_whow_joke-17	stay away from misogynist jokes if you’ve got an audience full of women;
GUM_whow_joke-18	people of a specific ethnic or racial group won’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group;
GUM_whow_joke-19	and jokes requiring specialized knowledge (of, for example, science or old movies) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge.
GUM_whow_joke-20	The more you know about your audience the better you’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them.
GUM_whow_joke-21	Choose great material.
GUM_whow_joke-22	You can find fodder lots of places — from your life, joke files online, by repurposing jokes you’ve heard in the past, and so on.
GUM_whow_joke-23	You may want to start your own joke file.
GUM_whow_joke-24	You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer. [1]
GUM_whow_joke-25	The latter option may allow for easier revision.
GUM_whow_joke-26	Decide on a target.
GUM_whow_joke-27	Every joke has a “target,” which is what the joke is about.
GUM_whow_joke-28	It’s important that the joke’s target (the most basic element of your material) be suited to your audience.
GUM_whow_joke-29	Make sure it’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they ’re likely willing to laugh at. [2]
GUM_whow_joke-30	For example, husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa;
GUM_whow_joke-31	students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous.
GUM_whow_joke-32	Have a realistic but exaggerated setup.
GUM_whow_joke-33	The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it, but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge. [3]
GUM_whow_joke-34	Think of the setup as the foundation of a story.
GUM_whow_joke-35	It’s a fundamental part of the joke;
GUM_whow_joke-36	if you don’t lay a good foundation here, then the punchline won’t make sense to the audience or they won’t find it humorous.
GUM_whow_joke-37	Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny —
GUM_whow_joke-38	it’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny. [4]
GUM_whow_joke-39	The exaggeration can be slight or considerable —
GUM_whow_joke-40	it just depends on the individual joke.
GUM_whow_joke-41	Surprise with the punchline.
GUM_whow_joke-42	The ending of the joke is obviously crucial.
GUM_whow_joke-43	This is where the payoff comes in, what makes the joke succeed or fail.
GUM_whow_joke-44	If you want to make the audience laugh, your punchline needs to be surprising.
GUM_whow_joke-45	Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper, which is an additional punchline.
GUM_whow_joke-46	The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way.
GUM_whow_joke-47	Make the joke your own.
GUM_whow_joke-48	Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told.
GUM_whow_joke-49	For your joke to be funny, it has to surprise the audience in some way, which means it has to seem original or new.
GUM_whow_joke-50	One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending. [5]
GUM_whow_joke-51	Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life.
GUM_whow_joke-52	This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable.
GUM_whow_joke-53	It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s). [6]
GUM_whow_joke-54	Know your material.
GUM_whow_joke-55	Practicing your joke is crucial.
GUM_whow_joke-56	You don’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact, you "shouldn’t" memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it, so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked, which is very possible once you ’re in front of an audience.
GUM_whow_joke-57	Memorized jokes sound wooden, like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer.
GUM_whow_joke-58	Good jokes have a lot of details and personality, so don’t be afraid to embellish. [7]
GUM_whow_joke-59	Try different things out and see what feels right, what sounds best.
GUM_whow_joke-60	Don’t use a joke until you ’re completely comfortable with it.
GUM_whow_joke-61	Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself.
GUM_whow_joke-62	If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s, your joke isn ’t ready and you need to practice more. [8]
GUM_whow_joke-63	You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you ’re ready for a “real” audience.
GUM_whow_overalls-1	How to Wash Overalls in a Washing Machine
GUM_whow_overalls-2	Whether you are a working man or just a little cutie trying to stay cute, those overalls are going to need washing sooner or later.
GUM_whow_overalls-3	The straps on adults’ overalls often get so twisted during the wash that one wishes she had just used an old fashioned washboard instead.
GUM_whow_overalls-4	Your appliances are also murder on the straps, which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls.
GUM_whow_overalls-5	This article will show you how to save time and prevent wear, extending the life of your overalls until they are so soft you could wear them to bed.
GUM_whow_overalls-6	Steps
GUM_whow_overalls-7	Wash alone or with "like" clothing.
GUM_whow_overalls-8	It’s best to wash adults’ overalls alone, especially men’s.
GUM_whow_overalls-9	However, it is okay to wash just a few items with them, like blue jeans.
GUM_whow_overalls-10	What you don’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps, like women’s long sleeve shirts or kids’ blankets.
GUM_whow_overalls-11	Think similar clothing, minus the twisty-ness.
GUM_whow_overalls-12	Just do the denim and canvas stuff together.
GUM_whow_overalls-13	Fasten the straps to the bib.
GUM_whow_overalls-14	If you didn’t know already, the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets.
GUM_whow_overalls-15	Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash.
GUM_whow_overalls-16	This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash.
GUM_whow_overalls-17	Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened.
GUM_whow_overalls-18	This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run.
GUM_whow_overalls-19	Don’t skip it.
GUM_whow_overalls-20	Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they don’t come loose.
GUM_whow_overalls-21	If your washing machine is worth its salt, it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it.
GUM_whow_overalls-22	All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience.
GUM_whow_overalls-23	Empty the pockets.
GUM_whow_overalls-24	Overalls have more pockets than pants.
GUM_whow_overalls-25	The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket.
GUM_whow_overalls-26	Kids put rocks, candy, and bugs in these.
GUM_whow_overalls-27	Men put cell phones and small tools in them.
GUM_whow_overalls-28	Women defy the laws of purse-space, so when it comes to bib pockets, the sky is the limit.
GUM_whow_overalls-29	Make sure all the pockets are empty.
GUM_whow_overalls-30	Move the strap adjusters around.
GUM_whow_overalls-31	You’ve probably got them just the way you like them, but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally, the straps will last longer.
GUM_whow_overalls-32	Depending on the adjusters, you may be able to leave them a little loose too.
GUM_whow_overalls-33	The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles (not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes).
GUM_whow_overalls-34	Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing.
GUM_whow_overalls-35	This is the same idea as rotating tires.
GUM_whow_overalls-36	You know about rotating your tires, don't you?
GUM_whow_overalls-37	Tips
GUM_whow_overalls-38	If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load, use about half the detergent called for and less water.
GUM_whow_overalls-39	Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer.
GUM_whow_overalls-40	This will cut down on some of the racket, but you 're still going to hear them.
GUM_whow_overalls-41	Warnings
GUM_whow_overalls-42	The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little, but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout.
GUM_whow_overalls-43	Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash, but may or may not melt in your dryer.
GUM_whow_overalls-44	Use with caution.
GUM_whow_skittles-1	How to Make Skittles Vodka
GUM_whow_skittles-2	Three Methods: Single Serving (25 mL Shot)
GUM_whow_skittles-3	Bottles of "Skittled"
GUM_whow_skittles-4	Vodka Dishwasher Bottle Method
GUM_whow_skittles-5	Making Skittles vodka is a fun way to add a splash of fruity flavor and color to regular vodka.
GUM_whow_skittles-6	All you need to do is place your favorite combination of Skittles candies into a glass or bottle of vodka and wait for it to infuse.
GUM_whow_skittles-7	You can then use your Skittles vodka to make brightly-colored cocktails or even serve it as a sugary shot!
GUM_whow_skittles-8	Find multiple methods for making Skittles vodka after the jump -- and soon you'll be tasting the rainbow!
GUM_whow_skittles-9	Ingredients
GUM_whow_skittles-10	A handle (1.75 liters, about a half gallon) of vodka per bag of Skittles
GUM_whow_skittles-11	A large bag of Skittles candy (the "movie size" bag)
GUM_whow_skittles-12	Method 1 of 3: Single Serving (25 mL Shot)
GUM_whow_skittles-13	Separate the colors of Skittles that you want to flavor the vodka with.
GUM_whow_skittles-14	Many people choose to leave out the green, which is lime if you 're using original Skittles, and purple, which is grape in the original style, as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product.
GUM_whow_skittles-15	However, you can put them in if you want.
GUM_whow_skittles-16	If you don't mind mixed flavors, you can just skip this step altogether.
GUM_whow_skittles-17	Add six Skittles to 25 ml of vodka.
GUM_whow_skittles-18	Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved.
GUM_whow_skittles-19	Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe.
GUM_whow_skittles-20	You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles.
GUM_whow_skittles-21	Filter out the remaining Skittle "insides".
GUM_whow_skittles-22	With single servings like this, you can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles, if you desire.
GUM_whow_skittles-23	Method 2 of 3: Bottles of "Skittled" Vodka
GUM_whow_skittles-24	Pour out some vodka from a bottle to make room for Skittles.
GUM_whow_skittles-25	Separate the Skittles by color.
GUM_whow_skittles-26	Add the Skittles (20 - 25 per 350 ml / 11.8 fl oz).
GUM_whow_skittles-27	Let the mixture sit for a day or two.
GUM_whow_skittles-28	Shake occasionally so the flavour mixes well.
GUM_whow_skittles-29	Strain out the Skittles using a filter, such as a paper coffee filter or a clean t-shirt.
GUM_whow_skittles-30	Refrigerate overnight.
GUM_whow_skittles-31	Method 3 of 3: Dishwasher Bottle Method
GUM_whow_skittles-32	Separate the colors from five bags of 200 g Skittles.
GUM_whow_skittles-33	Using 5 x 700 ml / 23.6 fl oz bottles, pour 300 ml / 10.1 fl oz of vodka into a jug and fill each bottle with skittles.
GUM_whow_skittles-34	Place the bottles in your dishwasher and put on an intensive cycle.
GUM_whow_skittles-35	One third of of the way through the cycle, shake all bottles vigorously.
GUM_whow_skittles-36	Two thirds of the way through the cycle, shake all bottles vigorously.
GUM_whow_skittles-37	Once the cycle has finished, shake all bottles vigorously again.
GUM_whow_skittles-38	Then place in the freezer for 2 hours.
GUM_whow_skittles-39	Once the vodka is cold, it should be syrupy.
GUM_whow_skittles-40	Take a sieve, line it with a piece of cheesecloth (muslin) or a coffee filter, place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly.
GUM_whow_skittles-41	Once the first bottle has been filtered, wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in.
GUM_whow_skittles-42	Repeat the above two steps for all bottles, ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination.
GUM_whow_skittles-43	Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink.
GUM_whow_skittles-44	Don't worry, the vodka won't freeze.
GUM_whow_skittles-45	You are finished.
GUM_whow_skittles-46	Enjoy your tasty creation.
GUM_whow_skittles-47	Tips.
GUM_whow_skittles-48	If you want to make it more quickly, cut the skittles in half before putting them into vodka.
GUM_whow_skittles-49	Shake every 15 minutes.
GUM_whow_skittles-50	They'll dissolve in an hour instead of a day.
GUM_whow_skittles-51	Or you could just scoop them out when the color dissolves.
GUM_whow_skittles-52	Start with small amount of vodka and Skittles at first to experiment which combination of taste suits you best.
GUM_whow_skittles-53	You can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste.
GUM_whow_skittles-54	The lime green Skittles add a sourness to the drink, so if you want one that's sweet, leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka.
GUM_whow_skittles-55	Another approach is to buy five bottles of vodka and five bags of Skittles.
GUM_whow_skittles-56	Then separate the candy and use one flavor for each bottle.
GUM_whow_skittles-57	(Or get four bottles and an empty, to allow room for the skittles.)
GUM_whow_skittles-58	If using a t-shirt to strain, be sure fabric softener or a dryer sheet had not been used with it, lets you get some extra (unwanted) flavoring (and potentially toxic chemicals).
GUM_whow_skittles-59	Warnings
GUM_whow_skittles-60	Drink responsibly.
GUM_whow_skittles-61	Never drink and drive.
GUM_whow_skittles-62	Know your limits, and do not drink to the extent of intoxication.
GUM_whow_skittles-63	Do not drink if underage in your country.
GUM_whow_skittles-64	Things You'll Need
GUM_whow_skittles-65	Each handle of vodka (1.75 liters, about a half gallon) requires a large bag worth of Skittles, so if you plan on doing only one flavor for a flavorful vodka, you'll have to buy 5 large bags of Skittles.
GUM_whow_skittles-66	Coffee filter, cheesecloth / muslin, or an extremely clean T-shirt
GUM_whow_skittles-67	Large funnel or strainer to hold filter
GUM_academic_discrimination-1	The prevalence of discrimination across racial groups in contemporary America:
GUM_academic_discrimination-2	Results from a nationally representative sample of adults
GUM_academic_discrimination-3	Introduction.
GUM_academic_discrimination-4	Personal experiences of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research. [1 - 3]
GUM_academic_discrimination-5	Sociologists have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [3 – 5];
GUM_academic_discrimination-6	psychologists have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [6];
GUM_academic_discrimination-7	neuroscientists have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [7 – 9];
GUM_academic_discrimination-8	and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species. [10]
GUM_academic_discrimination-9	In many respects, researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias. [11]
GUM_academic_discrimination-10	What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices.
GUM_academic_discrimination-11	Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings, for example, are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members. [12]
GUM_academic_discrimination-12	Indeed, the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are, at least to some appreciable amount, present in modern society.
GUM_academic_discrimination-13	Even so, estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare (see [13 – 14]).
GUM_academic_discrimination-14	At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [15], however, using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample, reported that approximately 33% of respondents reported some form of discrimination (see also, Gibbons et al. [4]).
GUM_academic_discrimination-15	The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large, nationally representative sample of adults from the United States.
GUM_academic_discrimination-16	Additionally, the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences.
GUM_academic_discrimination-17	Reason for discrimination.
GUM_academic_discrimination-18	All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against — specifically, those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above — were asked the following question:
GUM_academic_discrimination-19	“What do you think was the main reason for these experiences?”
GUM_academic_discrimination-20	Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories.
GUM_academic_discrimination-21	For the present analysis, these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options:
GUM_academic_discrimination-22	race / ancestry / skin color;
GUM_academic_discrimination-23	gender;
GUM_academic_discrimination-24	age;
GUM_academic_discrimination-25	religion;
GUM_academic_discrimination-26	height or weight;
GUM_academic_discrimination-27	sexual orientation;
GUM_academic_discrimination-28	education or income;
GUM_academic_discrimination-29	physical disability;
GUM_academic_discrimination-30	and other.
GUM_academic_discrimination-31	The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis: race; ancestry or national origin; and shade of skin color.
GUM_academic_discrimination-32	Additionally, because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences, the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing (legitimate skip).
GUM_academic_discrimination-33	Respondent race.
GUM_academic_discrimination-34	Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews, we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview.
GUM_academic_discrimination-35	Wave 1 race — rather than, say, Wave 3 race — was used to preserve case counts.
GUM_academic_discrimination-36	The logic is that (nearly) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample, but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition.
GUM_academic_discrimination-37	Respondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories: White; Black or African American; Hispanic; American Indian or Native American; and Asian or Pacific Islander.
GUM_academic_discrimination-38	Respondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race, and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial background.
GUM_academic_discrimination-39	In the current study, those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as “mixed race”.
GUM_academic_discrimination-40	Demographic variables.
GUM_academic_discrimination-41	To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole, two additional demographic variables are included.
GUM_academic_discrimination-42	First, age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents' birth (obtained from Wave 1) from the year of the interview at Wave 4.
GUM_academic_discrimination-43	Second, sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 (0 = female and 1 = male).
GUM_academic_discrimination-44	Analytical plan.
GUM_academic_discrimination-45	Our exploratory study included three basic steps.
GUM_academic_discrimination-46	First, summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced.
GUM_academic_discrimination-47	Second, we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category.
GUM_academic_discrimination-48	Finally, we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories.
GUM_academic_discrimination-49	In order to examine potential bivariate associations, the adjusted F statistic (design-based F) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health. [21]
GUM_academic_discrimination-50	More specifically, when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson χ2 statistic test of independence is converted into “an F statisticwith noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott (1981 [22], 1984 [23]) correction”. [24]
GUM_academic_discrimination-51	The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate (than the associated with the χ2 statistic) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data.
GUM_academic_discrimination-52	This final step also included an examination of the relative distribution of racial categories across the various reported reasons for discrimination.
GUM_academic_discrimination-53	As noted earlier, all analyses were weighted according to the survey weight provided by the Add Health research staff and standard errors were corrected for the clustering and stratification that defined the sampling strategy.
GUM_academic_discrimination-54	Thus, all estimates reported here can be considered nationally representative of the United States.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-1	2. GUJJOLAAY EEGIMAA, ITS SPEAKERS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS
GUM_academic_eegimaa-2	This section briefly presents the Gújjolaay Eegimaa (Eegimaa for short; Ethnologue code: ISO 639-3: bqj), its speakers and its varieties.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-3	We also discuss aspects of the contact situation of the Eegimaa language.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-4	This is important, because as we will show in §6 below, some of the Eegimaa death prevention names and child-bearing names are given to Eegimaa people from other communities.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-5	Eegimaa is a Jóola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal by a population estimated to be between 7,000 (Bassène, 2007) and 11,200 speakers (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2014).
GUM_academic_eegimaa-6	Jóola languages are classified as members of Sapir’s (1971) BAK group of Atlantic languages of the Niger Congo language phylum.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-7	Speakers of these languages are found in the Gambia, in the former Casamance region of Southern Senegal and in Guinea Bissau.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-8	The map in Figure 1, taken from Ethnologue, presents the languages of Senegal.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-9	The arrow on the map points to the Eegimaa speaking area (Bandial is the name used by Ethnologue for Eegimaa).
GUM_academic_eegimaa-10	Eegimaa is mainly spoken in Mof-Ávvi, a former kingdom of 10 villages located to the west of Ziguinchor, the capital city of the former administrative region of Casamance in the south of Senegal.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-11	Mof-Ávvi is a peninsula bordered by the Casamance River to the north, which separates it from the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny areas, and to the east by the villages Brin and Djibonker, where the speakers of Kujireray and Baïnounk Gubëeher live.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-12	In the south, the river known as Kamobeul Bolon separates Mof-Ávvi from the Bayot speaking area, while the west side of Mof-Ávvi coincides with the homeland of the Jóola Kaasa Húluf and Jóola Kaasa Ésuulaaluʔ.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-13	The map in Figure 2 below, adapted from Palmeri and Gazio (1995), shows a very approximate location of Mof-Ávvi in relation to other neighbouring speech communities.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-14	Some of these communities will be referred to in our discussion of death prevention names in § 6.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-15	The Eegimaa spoken in Mof-Ávvi is known by several names given by speakers of neighbouring languages.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-16	For example, the name Kusiilay 1 ‘the language of Essil’, is the name given by speakers of Kujireray to the Eegimaa language, because Essil, of which Bajjat was a district, is the village which has a border with their village.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-17	Endungo is the name given by Bayot speakers, but its meaning is not known.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-18	Kúlaakiay, ‘the language of village of Seleki / Sállagi’, is the name given by Jóola Kaasa speakers who are more familiar with the village of Seleki / Sállagi’ than all other villages of Mof-Ávvi.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-19	Finally, Banjal / Bandial‘the language of the village of Banjal’, the most popular of all those names, is the name given by the Jóola Búluf and Jóola Fogny speakers to Eegimaa people and their language, because people from the village of Banjal were the first to be in contact with them.

GUM_academic_eegimaa-23	Map of the Eegimaa speaking area
GUM_academic_eegimaa-24	Village names are written using their usual spelling.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-25	The Ethnologue language codes are provided for language varieties that have them.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-26	Language names are written following the recommendation for the transcription of national languages of Senegal, Decree 2005-981.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-27	Names of the villages of Mof-Ávvi are written using the Eegimaa orthography and following the pronunciation of village names by native speakers.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-28	Jóola language varieties which are closely related to Eegimaa include Kujireray / Kuluunaay(from the village of Brin with 76% lexical similarity) and Gufiñamay (from the village of Afiniam with 74% lexical similarity (based on Lewis et al., 2014 eds.)).
GUM_academic_eegimaa-29	Gútaamay (from the village of Butam), Gulapaoray (from the village Djilapaor) and Gusiilay (ISO 639-3: bsl) from the village of Thionk Essil are also other languages related to Eegimaa.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-30	They are located north of the Casamance River in the Jóola Búluf area.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-31	There are also small migrant Eegimaa communities in villages like Djifanghor (east of Ziguinchor) and in Bourofaye (south of Ziguinchor), where they cohabit with speakers of Baïnounk languages.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-32	Nowadays most Eegimaa speakers from Mof-Ávvi live outside their homeland, generally in urban areas like Ziguinchor and Dakar.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-33	Speakers of Eegimaa use the term Gújjolaay (meaning Jóola) to refer to their language when they speak to each other, but Eegimaa to distinguish their Jóola variety from that of other Jóola peoples.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-34	Eegimaa is an endangered language whose transmission to new generations has been declining significantly in the last decades.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-35	It is important to understand the contact situation of Eegimaa, because some of the ritual names analysed in this paper come from other languages or from neighbouring communities.
GUM_academic_eegimaa-36	These names are given either in Eegimaa or in a different language.
GUM_bio_dvorak-1	Antonín Dvořák
GUM_bio_dvorak-2	Antonín Leopold Dvořák (/ d(ə)ˈvɔːrʒɑːk, -ʒæk / d(ə)-VOR-zha(h)k; Czech: [ˈantoɲiːn ˈlɛopolt ˈdvor̝aːk]; 8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer.
GUM_bio_dvorak-3	After Bedřich Smetana, he was the next Czech Romantic-era composer to achieve worldwide recognition.
GUM_bio_dvorak-4	Following Smetana's nationalist example, Dvořák frequently employed aspects, specifically rhythms, of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia.
GUM_bio_dvorak-5	Dvořák's own style has been described as "the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them". [1]
GUM_bio_dvorak-6	Antonín Dvořák
GUM_bio_dvorak-7	Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six.
GUM_bio_dvorak-8	The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31.
GUM_bio_dvorak-9	Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later.
GUM_bio_dvorak-10	In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works.
GUM_bio_dvorak-11	Although Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed.
GUM_bio_dvorak-12	The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 [a] and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him.
GUM_bio_dvorak-13	Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances, Op. 46.
GUM_bio_dvorak-14	These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvořák's international reputation was launched at last.
GUM_bio_dvorak-15	Dvořák's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880.
GUM_bio_dvorak-16	It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. [2]
GUM_bio_dvorak-17	In his career, Dvořák made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works.
GUM_bio_dvorak-18	His Seventh Symphony was written for London.
GUM_bio_dvorak-19	Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. [3]
GUM_bio_dvorak-20	In 1891 Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory.
GUM_bio_dvorak-21	In 1890 – 91, he wrote his Dumky Trio, one of his most successful chamber music pieces.
GUM_bio_dvorak-22	In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City.
GUM_bio_dvorak-23	While in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony From the New World, which spread his reputation worldwide, [4] and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti.
GUM_bio_dvorak-24	He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music, the American String Quartet, during this time.
GUM_bio_dvorak-25	But shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895.
GUM_bio_dvorak-26	All of Dvořák's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works.
GUM_bio_dvorak-27	By far the most successful of the operas is Rusalka.
GUM_bio_dvorak-28	Among his smaller works, the seventh Humoresque and the song "Songs My Mother Taught Me" are also widely performed and recorded.
GUM_bio_dvorak-29	He has been described as "arguably the most versatile ... composer of his time". [5]
GUM_bio_jespersen-1	Otto Jespersen
GUM_bio_jespersen-2	Jens Otto Harry Jespersen or Otto Jespersen (Danish: [ʌtˢo ˈjɛsb̥ɐsn̩]; 16 July 1860 – 30 April 1943) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language.
GUM_bio_jespersen-3	Early life
GUM_bio_jespersen-4	Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland.
GUM_bio_jespersen-5	He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy, and with the help of Rask's grammars taught himself some Icelandic, Italian, and Spanish.
GUM_bio_jespersen-6	He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17, initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies.
GUM_bio_jespersen-7	In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages, and in 1887 earned his master's degree in French, with English and Latin as his secondary languages.
GUM_bio_jespersen-8	He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament.
GUM_bio_jespersen-9	In 1887 – 1888, he traveled to England, Germany and France, meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University.
GUM_bio_jespersen-10	Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen, he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system.
GUM_bio_jespersen-11	He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891.
GUM_bio_jespersen-12	Academic life and work
GUM_bio_jespersen-13	Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925, and served as Rector of the university in 1920 – 21.
GUM_bio_jespersen-14	His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics, but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development.
GUM_bio_jespersen-15	He advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers: Sprogets logik (1913) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser (1921).
GUM_bio_jespersen-16	Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax, and differentiates between primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries; e.g. in "well honed phrase," "phrase" is a primary, this being defined by a secondary, "honed", which again is defined by a tertiary "well".
GUM_bio_jespersen-17	The term Nexus is applied to sentences, structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation, in which two concepts are expressed in one unit; e.g., it rained, he ran indoors.
GUM_bio_jespersen-18	This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea, expressed by means of two or more elements, whereas a nexus combines two ideas.
GUM_bio_jespersen-19	Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics.
GUM_bio_jespersen-20	He was most widely recognized for some of his books.
GUM_bio_jespersen-21	Language: Its Nature, Development and Origin (1922) is considered by many to be his masterpiece.
GUM_bio_jespersen-22	Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles (1909 – 1949), concentrated on morphology and syntax, and Growth and Structure of the English Language (1905) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication.
GUM_bio_jespersen-23	Late in his life he published Analytic Syntax (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation.
GUM_bio_jespersen-24	In The Philosophy of Grammar (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case, pronoun, object, voice etc., and developed further his notions of Rank and Nexus.
GUM_bio_jespersen-25	In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguistics.
GUM_bio_jespersen-26	Mankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view (1925) is one of the pioneering works on Sociolinguistics.
GUM_bio_jespersen-27	Jespersen visited the United States twice:
GUM_bio_jespersen-28	he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904, and in 1909 – 1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia University.
GUM_bio_jespersen-29	While in the U.S., he took occasion to study the country's educational system.
GUM_bio_jespersen-30	His autobiography (see below) was published in English translation as recently as 1995.
GUM_bio_jespersen-31	Jespersen was a proponent of phonosemanticism and wrote:
GUM_bio_jespersen-32	“Is there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of sound symbolism (apart from the small class of evident echoisms and ‘onomatopoeia’) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning? ...
GUM_bio_jespersen-33	There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for.”
GUM_bio_jespersen-34	After his retirement in 1925, Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community.
GUM_bio_jespersen-35	In addition to continuing to write, he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930, and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936.
GUM_bio_jespersen-36	Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movement.
GUM_bio_jespersen-37	He was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1927 published his own project Novial.
GUM_bio_jespersen-38	He also worked with the International Auxiliary Language Association.
GUM_bio_jespersen-39	Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York (1910), St. Andrews University in Scotland (1925), and the Sorbonne in Paris (1927).
GUM_bio_jespersen-40	He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America.
GUM_fiction_falling-1	Falling
GUM_fiction_falling-2	You ’re on the 236th-level Kaiserstrasse moving sidewalk when you see her.
GUM_fiction_falling-3	You ’re leaning on the railing, waiting to ask Derya about a job, watching the glittering stream of mites that arc over half the sky — flying up to rewind their nanosprings in the stratospheric sunlight, flying down to make Frankfurt run.
GUM_fiction_falling-4	You never get tired of watching them.
GUM_fiction_falling-5	She’s on the Holbeinsteg bridge.
GUM_fiction_falling-6	Someone’s hung it up here — a hundred meters of clean gray and green twentieth-century modernism, plucked up from the river Main and suspended in the chilly air 2,360 meters up, between a lump of wooded parkland and a cluster of antique subway cars.
GUM_fiction_falling-7	She’s wearing a 1950s sundress and a broad-brimmed hat, and it’s like an essay on the last century — the austere steel bridge, the bright blobs of subway graffiti, and her yellow dress, flapping against her legs as she climbs over the bridge’s rail.
GUM_fiction_falling-8	A picture of elegance and style from the age of money, violence, and simplicity.
GUM_fiction_falling-9	She’s a strawberry blonde, slim, her skin blank and virginal as new butter.
GUM_fiction_falling-10	She’s beyond the rail now, hanging out over the mountain - high drop.
GUM_fiction_falling-11	Thin translucent shadows move across her — the shadows of the neosilk-and-nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five-kilometer-high towers that encircle it.
GUM_fiction_falling-12	(A civic agent notices you noticing, and attaches itself to your infospace, whispering statistics —
GUM_fiction_falling-13	“Each object’s suspension must weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80% of the towers” —
GUM_fiction_falling-14	“Frankfurt’s current population is stable at 53 million” —
GUM_fiction_falling-15	“Average age 62, birth rate 0.22, net immigration of half a million a year” —
GUM_fiction_falling-16	“Current personal squatright: 311 cubic meters per resident” —
GUM_fiction_falling-17	until you brush it away.)
GUM_fiction_falling-18	You ’re watching her lean out.
GUM_fiction_falling-19	The wind whips her hair, ruffles the skirt around her knees.
GUM_fiction_falling-20	She must be a tourist.
GUM_fiction_falling-21	You remember your first trip to the upper levels: leaning over the edge into the angry swarm of mites, whirring and buzzing warnings and shoving you back like a million mosquito chaperones.
GUM_fiction_falling-22	Everyone tries it once — Except that there aren’t any mites around her.
GUM_fiction_falling-23	You clutch the railing.
GUM_fiction_falling-24	Hot, animal fear surges in your chest.
GUM_fiction_falling-25	She looks up at you and, across the gap of forty meters, smiles a brilliant, heartbreaking smile.
GUM_fiction_falling-26	Then she lets go and falls.
GUM_fiction_falling-27	You scream.
GUM_fiction_falling-28	“Fucking airsurfers,” says Derya.
GUM_fiction_falling-29	He steps off the moving sidewalk near you: tall, hook-nosed, the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest; the glowing, formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps.
GUM_fiction_falling-30	You swallow on a dry throat.
GUM_fiction_falling-31	Derya, of all people, hearing you scream!
GUM_fiction_falling-32	He gives you a hooded look.
GUM_fiction_falling-33	“They infect themselves with some designer virus -
GUM_fiction_falling-34	it lets them hack the city’s person-recognition systems.
GUM_fiction_falling-35	So the mites don’t see them when they jump.
GUM_fiction_falling-36	Watch —”
GUM_fiction_falling-37	She’s swept past the whalelike oval of the public pool on the 202nd, past the sloping mandala of the Google of offices on the 164th.
GUM_fiction_falling-38	At the 131st, below her, is the old Stock Exchange, hung upside-down now as a hipster den.
GUM_fiction_falling-39	Now the mites are finally closing in.
GUM_fiction_falling-40	A silver swarm coalesces around the 164th, and she vanishes into it, like a snip of scallion into cloudy miso soup.
GUM_fiction_falling-41	When the cloud disperses, she’s standing on one of the Stock Exchange’s upside-down overhangs.
GUM_fiction_falling-42	She waves, antlike, then crawls through a dormer window.
GUM_fiction_falling-43	“It’s not funny,” Derya says.
GUM_fiction_falling-44	“They ’re a huge drain on emergency preparedness.
GUM_fiction_falling-45	Ripple effects are causing project slowdowns ...”
GUM_fiction_falling-46	“Freeloaders drive systemic evolution,” you find yourself saying.
GUM_fiction_falling-47	“Don’t you quote the founders at me,” Derya snaps.
GUM_fiction_falling-48	“The Free Society is fragile.
GUM_fiction_falling-49	The minute enough people find anticontributive behavior cool, the party’s over —
GUM_fiction_falling-50	it’s back to capitalist competition or state control.”
GUM_fiction_falling-51	He stares until you meet his eye.
GUM_fiction_falling-52	“You even talk to those people -
GUM_fiction_falling-53	are you paying attention? —
GUM_fiction_falling-54	you even talk to them, your rep will be trashed on all the major servers.
GUM_fiction_falling-55	You won’t work, you won’t party, you’ll be defriended by every one of your tribes.
GUM_fiction_falling-56	Got it?”
GUM_fiction_falling-57	Her broad-brimmed hat is still sailing on the wind.
GUM_fiction_falling-58	The mites missed it.
GUM_fiction_falling-59	It cuts between the towers of the 50th.
GUM_fiction_falling-60	The upside-down trading floor is deserted.
GUM_fiction_falling-61	There are heaps of yellowed euros and deutschmarks dumped here, like snowdrifts.
GUM_fiction_falling-62	Wood panel, marble.
GUM_fiction_falling-63	Silence.
GUM_fiction_falling-64	And the air is strangely clear.
GUM_fiction_falling-65	You realize: no mites.
GUM_fiction_falling-66	The city has no eyes or ears here.
GUM_fiction_falling-67	You walk through empty, miteless rooms, stepping around light fixtures.
GUM_fiction_falling-68	Then she’s there, in a doorway.
GUM_fiction_falling-69	Her eyes, bright blue, radiant.
GUM_fiction_falling-70	Her smile, with that chaste yellow dress, so bashful.
GUM_fiction_falling-71	She comes to you.
GUM_fiction_falling-72	“You want it?” she says.
GUM_fiction_falling-73	“You want to be infected?
GUM_fiction_falling-74	You want to fly?”
GUM_fiction_falling-75	You nod.
GUM_fiction_falling-76	Eyes closing, she leans in for the kiss.
GUM_fiction_teeth-1	Perfect Teeth
GUM_fiction_teeth-2	Steven wanted to be a dentist.
GUM_fiction_teeth-3	It was pretty much the first thing he told us when, as first years, we were all bunched together in the unfamiliar dusty classroom.
GUM_fiction_teeth-4	When, a couple of weeks later we were invited over to his house we saw that this was not an idle remark.
GUM_fiction_teeth-5	Where our bedroom walls were decorated with posters of pop stars and footballers, Steven had diagrams setting out tooth implementations, anatomical drawings of the jaw with brightly coloured nerves, muscle, blood vessels, bones, and, of course, teeth.
GUM_fiction_teeth-6	Where we had shelves of plastic dinosaurs and superhero figurines from cornflake boxes, Steven had plaster casts of jawbones, gums and teeth grinning down at us.
GUM_fiction_teeth-7	The instruments were locked away in glass cabinets and only his parents had the key.
GUM_fiction_teeth-8	“They don’t exactly encourage my interest,” he shrugged.
GUM_fiction_teeth-9	“They sort of tolerate it.
GUM_fiction_teeth-10	But Dad says they ’re a sort of collection, and too expensive for me to play with.”
GUM_fiction_teeth-11	Of course, we tried to pick the locks, but the spikes and saws and drillheads remained — tantalisingly — out of reach.
GUM_fiction_teeth-12	We didn’t see Steven’s interest as strange, well, not that much.
GUM_fiction_teeth-13	We all had our own interests — drawing, electronics, collecting beer caps — that each appeared obscure to anyone else.
GUM_fiction_teeth-14	DIY Dentistry was just something that had never crossed our horizon before.
GUM_fiction_teeth-15	And if Steven didn’t see it as weird, or no weirder than Andy showing us his Eastern-Block beer caps all laid out neatly on cork boards with little hand-written labels, why should it bother us?
GUM_fiction_teeth-16	I suppose that, in our own way, we were all collectively strange.
GUM_fiction_teeth-17	The bunch that no one picked for their side at football or hockey, and that was the glue that held us together.
GUM_fiction_teeth-18	Besides, Steven had some really good stuff: sweets that stained your teeth bright red — well, technically, not your teeth, just the plaque, but the result was often the same.
GUM_fiction_teeth-19	It took a few days good brushing to get it off.
GUM_fiction_teeth-20	Well, most of it anyway.
GUM_fiction_teeth-21	He had effervescent tablets that turned the canteen drinking water into that exact same pink mixture that the dentist gave you to rinse your mouth out after scraping around inside, and guaranteed to make the other kids splutter and spit it out when the taste slowly percolated through and met the memory of their last checkup.
GUM_fiction_teeth-22	Then there was the event that became the rite of passage into our group of misfits and outcasts: making a mould of your teeth.
GUM_fiction_teeth-23	It was inevitable that one of us, seeing the plaster casts on the shelf by Steven’s bed would ask how they were done.
GUM_fiction_teeth-24	It was just as inevitable that a few minutes later, Steven would be mixing up various powders and liquids, and pouring them into a horse-shoe shaped contraption.
GUM_fiction_teeth-25	It wasn’t dangerous.
GUM_fiction_teeth-26	At least, I suppose so.
GUM_fiction_teeth-27	It was vaguely uncomfortable, and appeared sufficiently disturbing that we all volunteered each other in turn until, at last, Andy said he was game.
GUM_fiction_teeth-28	And we were off.
GUM_fiction_teeth-29	The hardest part was probably to overcome the gagging reflex that set in when you bit down into the acrid resin jelly and it flowed out and up and around, over teeth, gums and tongue.
GUM_fiction_teeth-30	Your nose filled with what you imagined were fumes from the warm paste.
GUM_fiction_teeth-31	And you seemed to be suddenly drowning in your own saliva.
GUM_fiction_teeth-32	Things generally got better when Steven reminded you that you could actually breathe, and swallow, normally.
GUM_fiction_teeth-33	He watched the second hand trotting round the dial of his watch mouthing the quarters, before poking the setting goo to check its consistency.
GUM_fiction_teeth-34	Then, when he gave you the nod, you tried to prise your jaws apart.
GUM_fiction_teeth-35	As the seal around your gums and teeth was pretty solid, you thought it would never come off, as the others giggled at your expressions and grimaces.
GUM_fiction_teeth-36	Steven jiggled the handle that stuck out beyond your front teeth like some metallic duck’s bill, turning and twisting it most professionally and murmuring encouragements.
GUM_fiction_teeth-37	And, then, with an awful sucking slurp, it came free.
GUM_fiction_teeth-38	The initiated then revelled in retelling the gross sensation of having this evil-smelling plastic slug invade your mouth, while the others waited their turn with mixed trepidation and excitement.
GUM_fiction_teeth-39	Raucous laughter greeted the suggestions of the other body parts that could receive the same treatment.
GUM_fiction_teeth-40	The next part of the proceedings was less thrilling.
GUM_fiction_teeth-41	Steven measured and mixed the plaster of Paris and prepared for the cast by using a bright blue putty to build up the form of the jaw, and shoring up gaps and holes.
GUM_fiction_teeth-42	It get even less exciting when he said we’d have to wait an hour while the plaster set real solid.
GUM_fiction_teeth-43	But the next time we visited his room we got to marvel at our toothy grins labelled and lined up on the shelf.
GUM_fiction_teeth-44	We were all perfectly happy with the result, even wanting one as a trophy until Steven passed an expert eye over them, pointing out here a gap, here a filling, and there a completely misaligned incisor.
GUM_fiction_teeth-45	We were, he told us, mediocre specimens for his collection.
GUM_fiction_teeth-46	It didn’t matter.
GUM_fiction_teeth-47	We were all friends, a group bonded by the common experience of being able to see our teeth on Steven’s shelf.
GUM_interview_hill-1	Wikinews interviews Christopher Hill, U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate
GUM_interview_hill-2	Interview
GUM_interview_hill-3	What qualifications do you have that will assist you in executing the duties of president?
GUM_interview_hill-4	My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air Force.
GUM_interview_hill-5	I took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old.
GUM_interview_hill-6	I understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people.
GUM_interview_hill-7	Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters.
GUM_interview_hill-8	As President, I will serve ALL of the people in America, guided by the Constitution.
GUM_interview_hill-9	Why run for president?
GUM_interview_hill-10	Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change?
GUM_interview_hill-11	When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training.
GUM_interview_hill-12	The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy, Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend.
GUM_interview_hill-13	I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the "Top of the Spear."
GUM_interview_hill-14	In those days it was all or nothing.
GUM_interview_hill-15	If you graduated you were assigned a fighter, if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no response to fly another aircraft, you were washed out.
GUM_interview_hill-16	Congress has proven itself ineffective as a body.
GUM_interview_hill-17	To make a difference in America you must have the "Bully Pulpit" and speak to the People.
GUM_interview_hill-18	The President has that pulpit.
GUM_interview_hill-19	All or nothing.
GUM_interview_hill-20	I never wanted to make politics a career.
GUM_interview_hill-21	Why did you choose to run in the Republican Party?
GUM_interview_hill-22	My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979, when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire.
GUM_interview_hill-23	In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties.
GUM_interview_hill-24	Today, like many Americans, I am skeptical.
GUM_interview_hill-25	I understand third party candidates have no success.
GUM_interview_hill-26	I hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class Americans.
GUM_interview_hill-27	How do you plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls?
GUM_interview_hill-28	In order to be invited to the debates, we must raise money and poll nationally.
GUM_interview_hill-29	This is an effort that is underway.
GUM_interview_hill-30	Recently we were listed in New Hampshire and nationally with Politics1.
GUM_interview_hill-31	If you do not receive the Republican nomination, would you consider running as a third party candidate?
GUM_interview_hill-32	No, I will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016.
GUM_interview_hill-33	After that, I may reconsider.
GUM_interview_hill-34	Other than yourself, which candidates have you supported for president in previous campaigns?
GUM_interview_hill-35	Reagan in 80 and 84, [George H. W.] Bush in 88 and 92, [Phil] Gramm in 96, [George W.] Bush in 2000 and, Romney in 08.
GUM_interview_hill-36	What are your thoughts on the job Barack Obama has done as president?
GUM_interview_hill-37	Specifically, what would you have done differently?
GUM_interview_hill-38	President Obama has an agenda that represents the far left wing of his party.
GUM_interview_hill-39	His use of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutional.
GUM_interview_hill-40	Specifically, altering law once it is passed to accommodate his voting blocs.
GUM_interview_hill-41	His direction to Eric Holder to enforce some laws and not others is another example.
GUM_interview_hill-42	Hill at the Lesser-known candidates forum in 2011
GUM_interview_hill-43	If elected, what would constitute a successful presidency for you?
GUM_interview_hill-44	Achieving four goals:
GUM_interview_hill-45	Term Limits for Congress and the Courts returning government to the People.
GUM_interview_hill-46	Implementing a Tax System that allows working Americans making under $ 250,000 to keep all of their money.
GUM_interview_hill-47	Closing Loopholes and putting in place a system that is transparent and works.
GUM_interview_hill-48	Passing a Living Wage program lifting people out of poverty.
GUM_interview_hill-49	Returning America to a state of Peace and Security.
GUM_interview_hill-50	What individuals would you like to see in a Hill administration?
GUM_interview_hill-51	I would like to bring People from the heartland of America that make this nation work.
GUM_interview_hill-52	We have had too many decades of Ivy League elites and Professors immersed in theory.
GUM_interview_hill-53	Hill (right) with fellow 2012 presidential candidate Buddy Roemer.
GUM_interview_hill-54	Anything else you would like to add?
GUM_interview_hill-55	A final thought.
GUM_interview_hill-56	America is a nation that will endure.
GUM_interview_hill-57	I believe it is our responsibility to pass on the same opportunities to future generations that were promised to us.
GUM_interview_hill-58	As President, I intend to keep that promise!
GUM_interview_libertarian-1	Wikinews interviews Robert Sarvis, Libertarian Party nominee for Governor of Virginia
GUM_interview_libertarian-2	Saturday, October 19, 2013
GUM_interview_libertarian-3	Attorney Robert Sarvis, the Libertarian Party's nominee for Governor of Virginia, answered five questions submitted via e-mail by accredited Wikinews reporter William Saturn.
GUM_interview_libertarian-4	Sarvis has garnered double digits in opinion polls for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election, an unusual feat for a third party candidate.
GUM_interview_libertarian-5	The latest Newsmax / Zogby poll from late September placed him at 13 percent, 14 points behind Republican Party nominee Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia's Attorney General, and 19 points behind Democratic Party nominee Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, with 24 percent undecided.
GUM_interview_libertarian-6	Whoever wins election on November 5, 2013, would replace outgoing governor Bob McDonnell.
GUM_interview_libertarian-7	On his campaign website, Sarvis notes he favors parental school choice through student vouchers, simplification of Virginia's Tax Code, US Second Amendment - gun - rights, same-sex marriage, and reform of the state's drug laws.
GUM_interview_libertarian-8	With Wikinews, Sarvis discusses his background, views on McDonnell's tenure, keys to campaign success, plan to implement his agenda, and the former Virginia governor he most admires.
GUM_interview_libertarian-9	Interview
GUM_interview_libertarian-10	What is the most important aspect of your background that voters should know about?
GUM_interview_libertarian-11	I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia, but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth.
GUM_interview_libertarian-12	(I am mixed-race (half-Chinese) and in an interracial marriage.)
GUM_interview_libertarian-13	I am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law, and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurship.
GUM_interview_libertarian-14	Because of my academic and professional background, I understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates, and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrum.
GUM_interview_libertarian-15	I am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law.
GUM_interview_libertarian-16	What are your thoughts on the job Bob McDonnell has done as Governor of Virginia?
GUM_interview_libertarian-17	What would you have done differently than him?
GUM_interview_libertarian-18	McDonnell did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recession.
GUM_interview_libertarian-19	Those early budget efforts are his highest achievements as Governor.
GUM_interview_libertarian-20	More recently, he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases, rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational, efficient, decentralized transportation decision-making.
GUM_interview_libertarian-21	He could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform, regulatory reform, and school choice.
GUM_interview_libertarian-22	Of course, he showed ethical lapses in judgment.
GUM_interview_libertarian-23	Compared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level, you have done exceptionally well in opinion polling.
GUM_interview_libertarian-24	What do you attribute that success to?
GUM_interview_libertarian-25	Voters see the two-party system for the sham it has become.
GUM_interview_libertarian-26	They are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaigns.
GUM_interview_libertarian-27	Voters see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties, and they want something better.
GUM_interview_libertarian-28	Voters who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere, know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions, and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interest.
GUM_interview_libertarian-29	People like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open-minded and Open for Business.
GUM_interview_libertarian-30	If elected governor, how will you be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature?
GUM_interview_libertarian-31	There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature, and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor.
GUM_interview_libertarian-32	Libertarians share many policy positions with each of the major parties.
GUM_interview_libertarian-33	Working together with both Republicans and Democrats, we can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of both.
GUM_interview_libertarian-34	Moreover, electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual, and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives, meaning that much more is possible than many people assume, especially with strong leadership.
GUM_interview_libertarian-35	Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why?
GUM_interview_libertarian-36	Thomas Jefferson.
GUM_interview_libertarian-37	He was incredibly learned and was a strong advocate for freedom and the rule of law.
GUM_interview_libertarian-38	He would be a Libertarian today.
GUM_interview_libertarian-39	Robert Sarvis.

GUM_interview_mcguire-1	Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire
GUM_interview_mcguire-2	Sunday, May 28, 2006
GUM_interview_mcguire-3	The LibriVox website features a catalog of about a hundred completed books, including books in other languages like German, Hebrew, and Japanese.
GUM_interview_mcguire-4	Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands, and how did you go about it?
GUM_interview_mcguire-5	I think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world, and so I thought: here's a way to help the cause.
GUM_interview_mcguire-6	I launched LibriVox, emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff, and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent.
GUM_interview_mcguire-7	Things have grown steadily since.
GUM_interview_mcguire-8	By the way, AKMA was the first guy I know of to do something like this, with Lawrence Lessig's Free Culture.
GUM_interview_mcguire-9	That, I think, started my thinking about this, but it took a while for the idea to crystallize.
GUM_interview_mcguire-10	Hugh McGuire with some books that have not yet been acoustically liberated.
GUM_interview_mcguire-11	Do you personally record audiobooks, and did you already do so before LibriVox?
GUM_interview_mcguire-12	LibriVox was my first experience recording audiobooks.
GUM_interview_mcguire-13	I still do the odd chapter, but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days!
GUM_interview_mcguire-14	Is there a particular LibriVox book which you think stands out because of the quality, the overall effort involved, its popularity, or for some other reason?
GUM_interview_mcguire-15	My personal favourite is Notes from the Underground (Dostoyevsky).
GUM_interview_mcguire-16	Other random good ones:
GUM_interview_mcguire-17	Austen, Jane.
GUM_interview_mcguire-18	Pride and Prejudice
GUM_interview_mcguire-19	Christie, Agatha.
GUM_interview_mcguire-20	The Mysterious Affair at Styles
GUM_interview_mcguire-21	London, Jack.
GUM_interview_mcguire-22	White Fang
GUM_interview_mcguire-23	Macaulay, Thomas Babington.
GUM_interview_mcguire-24	History of England (Volume 1, Chapter 1)
GUM_interview_mcguire-25	Marx, Karl and Engels, Friedrich.
GUM_interview_mcguire-26	The Communist Manifesto (solo)
GUM_interview_mcguire-27	Twain, Mark.
GUM_interview_mcguire-28	A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (solo)
GUM_interview_mcguire-29	Ed.: See the LibriVox catalog for a full index.
GUM_interview_mcguire-30	Browsing the catalog, I find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter.
GUM_interview_mcguire-31	If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they didn't like the speaker, would you then offer two versions?
GUM_interview_mcguire-32	Yes.
GUM_interview_mcguire-33	We take the Wikipedia approach: if you think it should be better, please help it be so.
GUM_interview_mcguire-34	You'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books.
GUM_interview_mcguire-35	Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice: each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version, so you get 20 + versions of the same poem, a very interesting audio experience.
GUM_interview_mcguire-36	Besides works whose copyright has expired, there is an increasing number of modern books available under Creative Commons and similar licenses.
GUM_interview_mcguire-37	You mentioned Larry Lessig's Free Culture, but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept, such as O'Reilly.
GUM_interview_mcguire-38	Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works, or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well?
GUM_interview_mcguire-39	We are only doing public domain works, for a number of reasons, partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means its as simple as can be.
GUM_interview_mcguire-40	CC makes things more complex.
GUM_interview_mcguire-41	Also, there are other sites, notably podiobooks.com, which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox.
GUM_interview_mcguire-42	we find it makes things clear and easy to say: published works, public domain, and leave it at that.
GUM_interview_mcguire-43	As far as I can tell, podiobooks.com features "free as in beer" content — material which you can download, but which isn't under a free content license.
GUM_interview_mcguire-44	Instead of "public domain", wouldn't "free content" work just as well, using something like the Free Content Definition to limit the scope?
GUM_interview_mcguire-45	This needs more discussion obviously: we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we didn't want to add new restrictions, especially not non-commercial, since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects (I can't recall any specific project names, but some pay-education sites use LV stuff).
GUM_interview_mcguire-46	That's good and well and fine with us.
GUM_interview_mcguire-47	We don't want to have to give anyone permission to use our recordings, we want anyone to use them for whatever they want.
GUM_interview_mcguire-48	Also, for the thing to work you need to have many dedicated volunteers willing to do the management (onerous) and many willing to do the reading.
GUM_interview_mcguire-49	While Pride and Prejudice will attract many readers, I don't know about O'Reilly's latest tome on XML ... though I might be wrong.

GUM_news_expo-13	In the 20-minute PlayStation VR demonstration of Batman: Arkham VR, players are dropped down a secret elevator in Bruce Wayne's manor, to the Bat Cave, to suit up.
GUM_news_expo-14	From there, the demonstration took players to investigate the murder of Nightwing.
GUM_news_expo-15	The Northern Arena Esports Championship ran throughout the weekend, facing off teams of video gamers in a packed hall.
GUM_news_expo-16	Even in early rounds, the event was well attended, with the stands full of gamers, watching the matches with live colour commentary.
GUM_news_expo-17	The finals saw US team Cloud9 and Immortals, from Brazil, face off in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
GUM_news_expo-18	Both unbeaten teams going in, the Brazillian team won the championship and $ 50,000.
GUM_news_expo-19	Gameplay was delayed during the "third map" (third round) of the finals, when one Immortals player was caught with their headset off.
GUM_news_expo-20	After nearly half an hour, the team was deducted a point, leading to a sudden but temporary rush of success by the US team.

GUM_news_nasa-1	NASA celebrates 30th anniversary of first shuttle launch; announces new homes for retired shuttles
GUM_news_nasa-2	Wednesday, April 13, 2011
GUM_news_nasa-3	NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announces where four space shuttle orbiters will be permanently displayed at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle Program during an event commemorating the 30th anniversay of the first shuttle launch on April 12, 2011.
GUM_news_nasa-4	Image: NASA Bill Ingalls.
GUM_news_nasa-5	NASA celebrated the launch of the first space shuttle Tuesday at an event at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
GUM_news_nasa-6	On April 12, 1981, Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center on STS-1, the first space shuttle mission.
GUM_news_nasa-7	NASA held a ceremony commemorating the date outside the hangar, known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1, for Space Shuttle Atlantis, which is being prepped for its final mission which will be STS-135, which will be the last Space Shuttle mission.
GUM_news_nasa-8	At the ceremony, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announced the locations that would be given the three remaining Space Shuttle orbiters following the end of the Space Shuttle program.
GUM_news_nasa-9	The prototype orbiter, Space Shuttle Enterprise would be relocated from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City.
GUM_news_nasa-10	Space Shuttle Discovery will take the place of Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy Center.
GUM_news_nasa-11	Discovery has already been retired following the completion of STS-133 last month, its 39th mission.
GUM_news_nasa-12	Discovery is undergoing decommissioning and currently being prepped for display by removing toxic materials from the orbiter.
GUM_news_nasa-13	Looking back: Space Shuttle Columbia lifts off on STS-1 from Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center on April 12, 1981.
GUM_news_nasa-14	Image: NASA.
GUM_news_nasa-15	Space Shuttle Endeavour, which will launch on STS-134 at the end of the month on April 29, will be sent to the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California following its retirement.
GUM_news_nasa-16	Finally, Atlantis will go on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex following the orbiter's last flight which launches June 28.
GUM_news_nasa-17	Columbia was lost tragically back on February 1, 2003 when it disintegrated during re-entry killing all seven astronauts aboard.
GUM_news_nasa-18	Space Shuttle Challenger was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28, 1986 killing all six aboard.
GUM_news_nasa-19	"We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures," said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees.
GUM_news_nasa-20	"This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mind.
GUM_news_nasa-21	In the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle Program.
GUM_news_nasa-22	These facilities we've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors."
GUM_news_nasa-23	This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mind.
GUM_news_nasa-24	In the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle Program.

GUM_news_nasa-28	Not all were pleased with the final choice of locations.
GUM_news_nasa-29	U.S. Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas, issued a statement regarding the rejection of Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas as a location.
GUM_news_nasa-30	"Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle Orbiters.
GUM_news_nasa-31	Houston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet."
GUM_news_nasa-32	Cornyn's statement added, "There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters — even Administrator Bolden stated as much.
GUM_news_nasa-33	Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and Im deeply disappointed with the Administration's misguided decision.“
GUM_news_nasa-34	However, the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deck.
GUM_news_nasa-35	The Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington was also proposed as another location for a shuttle, going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiter.
GUM_news_nasa-36	In a statement, Governor of Washington Chris Gregoire said, "The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest.
GUM_news_nasa-37	As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit.
GUM_news_nasa-38	While the Museum of Flight was in the top running, Im disappointed that NASA did not choose them.
GUM_news_nasa-39	In 2008, Endeavour and Atlantis await a journey on their respective launchpads.
GUM_news_nasa-40	Image: NASA.
GUM_news_nasa-41	"However, the full fuselage trainer, that every astronaut including [former Museum of Flight CEO] Bonnie Dunbar has been trained on, will soon call the Museum of Flight home.
GUM_news_nasa-42	The largest of the trainers, this addition will allow visitors to actually climb aboard the trainer and experience the hands-on training that astronauts get.
GUM_news_nasa-43	Visitors will not be allowed in the other shuttles and this trainer is a true win for our dynamic museum.
GUM_news_nasa-44	It will help inspire young people to the adventure of space and to the excitement of a career in science, technology, engineering and math."
GUM_news_nasa-45	Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and Im deeply disappointed with the Administration's misguided decision.
GUM_news_nasa-46	John Cornyn, U.S. Senator (R-Texas)
GUM_news_nasa-47	Other items include various shuttle simulators which will be given to the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, Illinois, the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum of McMinnville, Oregon, and Texas A&M's Aerospace Engineering Department.
GUM_news_nasa-48	The nose cap assembly and crew compartment trainer for the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and orbital maneuvering system engines for the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the National Air and Space Museum, and the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum.
GUM_news_nasa-49	NASA is also offering shuttle heat shield tiles to schools and universities that want to share technology and a piece of space history with their students.
GUM_news_nasa-50	The 30th anniversary of the first shuttle mission coincided with the 50th anniversary of the first manned space flight when Yuri Gagarin lifted off aboard Vostok 1 into space.
GUM_news_sensitive-1	Sensitive Canadian document found on rainy streets
GUM_news_sensitive-2	Friday, August 15, 2008
GUM_news_sensitive-3	A sensitive Environment Canada document was found wet on an Ottawa street by someone who gave it to the CBC today.
GUM_news_sensitive-4	The 131-page document was found on Castlefrank Road in Kanata, Ontario in a rain-stained, tire-marked brown envelope by a passerby.
GUM_news_sensitive-5	The document which had the stamp Protected B on every page detailed various security vulnerabilities of the NEMISIS database which is used by officers to track and prosecute environmental law-breakers.
GUM_news_sensitive-6	If someone were able to shut the system down, or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information, it could affect the prosecution of the lawbreakers.
GUM_news_sensitive-7	The database was unveiled in 1999 as the National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence System.
GUM_news_sensitive-8	However, on the document, it referred to the database as National Enforcement and Emergency Management Information System and Intelligence System, adding the words "and Emergency" to the name.
GUM_news_sensitive-9	Protection B documents are the second lowest grade of classified government documents.
GUM_news_sensitive-10	Environment Canada spokesperson Julie Hahn said they apply to letters of complaint, criticism or injury, research or scientific notes and findings that don`t have any conclusion, and Treasury Board letters, agendas and minutes that don`t deal with subjects of national interest.
GUM_news_sensitive-11	Environment Minister John Baird has asked government officials how such documents that are supposed to be stored in "approved security cabinets" wound up on the street.
GUM_news_sensitive-12	"I'm told two things: that it's neither classified nor secret and that it's stuff that could be available under access to information," Baird said.
GUM_news_sensitive-13	Environment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani told CBC News the department will look into the incident.
GUM_news_sensitive-14	"We take document security seriously," she said, but refused to give any more details about how the papers came to be on a road.
GUM_news_sensitive-15	Paul Dewar, an Ottawa New Democrat MP, said the combined security lapses raise serious questions about the government's ability to secure sensitive documents.
GUM_news_sensitive-16	Dewar says that bureaucrats of the Conservative government have complained to him about document security to the point that they can`t share the information with their own colleagues.
GUM_news_sensitive-17	However, when a government document has been found on the streets, the government then says it wasn't particularly sensitive.
GUM_news_sensitive-18	"This government is so consumed with control of information and secrecy yet they don't seem to be able to get the fundamentals right," Dewar said.
GUM_news_sensitive-19	The incident is a reminiscent of two other incidents.
GUM_news_sensitive-20	In March, a bundle of blueprints for a new headquarters for the military's counterterrorism unit were found stuffed in the trash on a downtown street.
GUM_news_sensitive-21	In May, Maxime Bernier was forced to resign as Foreign Affairs minister after it became known that he left sensitive documents at the apartment of his then-girlfriend Julie Couillard who had ties to the Hells Angels biker gang.

GUM_voyage_oakland-1	Understand
GUM_voyage_oakland-2	Some of the distinctive skyline of Downtown, including the Kaiser Building and the Cathedral of Christ the Light.
GUM_voyage_oakland-3	Often overshadowed by San Francisco, its larger neighbor lying directly to the west, Oakland has in recent years began to step out from under the shadows, playing upon the beautiful highlights of its own and its rise as the multicultural "hipster' city of the Bay Area.
GUM_voyage_oakland-4	Since the 1960s, Oakland has been a hub of radical culture, and is the birthplace of both the Black Panther Party and the Hell's Angels.
GUM_voyage_oakland-5	Oakland's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well, as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Amy Tan, and Maya Angelou; actors Meryl Streep, Mark Hamill, Bruce Lee, and Tom Hanks; architect Julia "Butterfly" Hill; classical conductor Calvin Simmons; rappers MC Hammer, 2Pac, Messy Marv, and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences.
GUM_voyage_oakland-6	Oakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history.
GUM_voyage_oakland-7	For many visitors, the first place they are likely to visit is Downtown, especially if they are in town on business, or simply do not know where to start.
GUM_voyage_oakland-8	The center of transportation by BART and by bus is there, if one wants to branch out.
GUM_voyage_oakland-9	And it is as simple as walking in a direction from there, for the first few neighborhoods, since Old Oakland is along 10th Street, just west of Broadway.
GUM_voyage_oakland-10	Just east of Broadway and continuing north and south is Oakland's famous Chinatown, and that to get the real essence of "Chinatown," Oakland rather than San Francisco is your best bet.
GUM_voyage_oakland-11	Many of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history, in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhood.
GUM_voyage_oakland-12	The curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway, and come to Jack London Square.
GUM_voyage_oakland-13	The unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the city's waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore, even for locals.
GUM_voyage_oakland-14	It's the home of the USS Potomac and the site of the namesake author's residence, still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same era.
GUM_voyage_oakland-15	Just west of Downtown and slightly north of the Financial District is Uptown.
GUM_voyage_oakland-16	In the evening it buzzes with art galleries, theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concerts.
GUM_voyage_oakland-17	A popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hop.
GUM_voyage_oakland-18	It's a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls, avant-garde performance art, and even an improv theater company.
GUM_voyage_oakland-19	Uptown also has some of the best in the city's vintage architecture, like the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building and the Art Deco Fox and Paramount Theaters, as well as several restaurants.
GUM_voyage_oakland-20	North Oakland is a sweeping term, referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake Merritt.
GUM_voyage_oakland-21	Many of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and Chinatown.
GUM_voyage_oakland-22	Temescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown, centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue, at and near 51st Street.
GUM_voyage_oakland-23	Until the 1960s, a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood, it is now a much more diversified neighborhood, home to many restaurants, including some of the city's best Korean and Ethiopian establishments.
GUM_voyage_oakland-24	Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge, a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes.
GUM_voyage_oakland-25	It has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and styles.
GUM_voyage_oakland-26	Open-air markets, bookstores, and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North Oakland.
GUM_voyage_oakland-27	South of Rockridge, and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue, a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill (Pill Hill) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills, houses and trees.
GUM_voyage_oakland-28	Another of North Oakland's group of foodie spots, home to the city's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others; cafes, ice cream, coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood.
GUM_voyage_oakland-29	East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks.
GUM_voyage_oakland-30	Grand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly, suburban sort of feel.
GUM_voyage_oakland-31	The Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name, a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue – both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget, be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening, either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time, by day or night.
GUM_voyage_oakland-32	West Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th century.
GUM_voyage_oakland-33	It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past.
GUM_voyage_oakland-34	Strangely, twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes.
GUM_voyage_oakland-35	After the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated there, and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands.
GUM_voyage_oakland-36	With Loma Prieta in 1989, the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed, and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood's original Victorian houses, and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood.
GUM_voyage_oakland-37	Though there are a few draws for the traveler, West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation.
GUM_voyage_thailand-1	Respect
GUM_voyage_thailand-2	Thais are a polite people and, while remarkably tolerant of foreigners gallivanting on their beaches and with their women, youll find that you will get more respect if you in turn treat them and their customs with respect.
GUM_voyage_thailand-3	The wai
GUM_voyage_thailand-4	Ronald McDonald showing how it's done
GUM_voyage_thailand-5	The traditional greeting known as the wai, where you press your hands together as is in prayer and bow slightly, is derived from the Hindu cultural influence from India, and still widely practised.
GUM_voyage_thailand-6	Among Thais, there are strict rules of hierarchy that dictate how and when the wai should be given.
GUM_voyage_thailand-7	In brief, inferiors salute superiors first.
GUM_voyage_thailand-8	You should not wai service people or street vendors.
GUM_voyage_thailand-9	The higher your hands go, the more respectful you are.
GUM_voyage_thailand-10	You will also often see Thais doing a wai as they walk past temples and spirit houses.
GUM_voyage_thailand-11	As a foreign visitor, you are not expected to know how to wai, nor to reciprocate when wai'd to;
GUM_voyage_thailand-12	while you 're unlikely to cause offense if you do, you may well look slightly strange.
GUM_voyage_thailand-13	If somebody makes a wai to you, a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions, and for business, most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway.
GUM_voyage_thailand-14	Dress
GUM_voyage_thailand-15	Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people.
GUM_voyage_thailand-16	You will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return.
GUM_voyage_thailand-17	This translates in many ways, even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets.
GUM_voyage_thailand-18	While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners, Thais respond more positively to well-dressed Westerners.
GUM_voyage_thailand-19	Traditionally, Thais are modest and conservative dressers.
GUM_voyage_thailand-20	At a minimum your clothes should be neat, clean, and free from holes or tears.
GUM_voyage_thailand-21	Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women, except that you should avoid clothing showing a lot of skin.
GUM_voyage_thailand-22	Pants are preferable to shorts, blouses should have capped sleeves, and if tank tops are worn, the straps should be thick (i.e., not spaghetti straps).
GUM_voyage_thailand-23	Thai men generally wear pants, and most Thais view an adult man wearing shorts as fairly ridiculous;
GUM_voyage_thailand-24	shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren.
GUM_voyage_thailand-25	Men's shorts should be knee length or more, if worn at all.
GUM_voyage_thailand-26	Taking off one's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette, and this may even be requested at some shops.
GUM_voyage_thailand-27	Wear shoes that slip on and off easily.
GUM_voyage_thailand-28	Flip-flops, hiking sandals, and clog-type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand;
GUM_voyage_thailand-29	only in the most top-end establishments are shoes required.
GUM_voyage_thailand-30	It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand;
GUM_voyage_thailand-31	your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs.
GUM_voyage_thailand-32	For men, ankle-length pants are mandatory;
GUM_voyage_thailand-33	on top, t-shirts are acceptable, though a button-front or polo shirt would be best.
GUM_voyage_thailand-34	Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts;
GUM_voyage_thailand-35	you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle-length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops.
GUM_voyage_thailand-36	Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate, as are short skirts.
GUM_voyage_thailand-37	The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors, so even if you see a local in shorts it's not OK for everyone.
GUM_voyage_thailand-38	Topless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches.
GUM_voyage_thailand-39	At beaches which are primarily Thai visitors however, this is not advised.
GUM_voyage_thailand-40	Religion
GUM_voyage_thailand-41	Buddhist prayer flags, Wat Arun, Bangkok
GUM_voyage_thailand-42	Monks are an integral part of Buddhism in Thailand, and Thai men are generally expected to spend a certain amount of time living as a monk at least once in their lifetime.
GUM_voyage_thailand-43	Buddhist monks are meant to avoid sexual temptations, and in particular they do not touch women or take things from women's hands.
GUM_voyage_thailand-44	Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you.
GUM_voyage_thailand-45	Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands.
GUM_voyage_thailand-46	Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up, or place it on a special cloth he carries with him.
GUM_voyage_thailand-47	Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman who will accept things from women merit-makers on their behalf.
GUM_voyage_thailand-48	Theravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations and as such, are not allowed to touch money, so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures.
GUM_voyage_thailand-49	Therefore, should you wish to donate to a monk, you should only offer food, and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple.
GUM_voyage_thailand-50	Those monks that accept money are almost always fakes.
GUM_voyage_vavau-1	Vava’u is a group of more than 50 islands in Tonga, about 150 miles north of Tongatapu.
GUM_voyage_vavau-2	They are either raised coral limestone or coral atolls.
GUM_voyage_vavau-3	The beautiful harbour opposite the main town of Neiafu (known as the Port of Refuge Harbour) is a common destination for yachties sailing the South Pacific.
GUM_voyage_vavau-4	The waters of the islands are known for their clarity, it being said that you can see the bottom at 40 metres.
GUM_voyage_vavau-5	The area attracts many humpback whales between June and November and there are lots of companies organising tours to see them.
GUM_voyage_vavau-6	There are numerous places to stay to suit most budgets.
GUM_voyage_vavau-7	Understand
GUM_voyage_vavau-8	Findings of Lapita pottery suggest that early-Polynesians were on these islands close to 3000 years ago.
GUM_voyage_vavau-9	These days there are around 20000 people living in the Group.
GUM_voyage_vavau-10	Neiafu and surrounding villages are home to about a third of the Group’s overall population of around 20000, with the majority of the population living in small villages on the other islands.
GUM_voyage_vavau-11	Neiafu is the official port of entry for yachts coming to Vava'u, which attracts over 500 yachts every winter sailing season between June and October.
GUM_voyage_vavau-12	A string of islands and reefs along the eastern edge of the Group shelters the area from strong winds and ocean swellS and humpback whales come to these protected waters to give birth.
GUM_voyage_vavau-13	This is the high season for tourism;
GUM_voyage_vavau-14	between December and April few people visit and many tour companies and restaurants close down.
GUM_voyage_vavau-15	Neiafu town is the centre of activity.
GUM_voyage_vavau-16	It is on the southern point of the main island of Utu Vava'u and has an attractive setting on one of the world's most beautiful harbours.

GUM_voyage_vavau-26	The main islands are: Utu Vava'u.
GUM_voyage_vavau-27	This is the largest island, where Neiafu is found.
GUM_voyage_vavau-28	It is a limestone island with heights up to 213 m in the west.
GUM_voyage_vavau-29	The island provides a home to eleven indigenous bird species and contains Mt. Talau national park, with some of the limited remaining native vegetation.
GUM_voyage_vavau-30	Tropical vegetation includes the pandanus or screw pine, the casuarina, and the mulberry tree, the bark of which is used to make tapa cloth.
GUM_voyage_vavau-31	Pangaimotu.
GUM_voyage_vavau-32	This is the second largest island in the Group.

GUM_voyage_vavau-37	This is some 35 minutes from Neiafu Harbour and provides the main concentration of humpback whales.
GUM_voyage_vavau-38	The island lies in deep water and has sheltered waters and bays which provide a resting place for humpbacks with calves.
GUM_whow_cactus-1	How to Grow Beavertail Cactus
GUM_whow_cactus-2	The Beavertail Cactus (Opunitia basilares), found primarily in the Mojave Desert and northwest Mexico; can grow to be about 24 inches (60 cm) high; has pads that look like beavertails; and yields red or purple flowers from spring to early summer.
GUM_whow_cactus-3	Growing Beavertail can be done at any time of year by scattering seeds in a shady bed or, for faster results, planting cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring that they have a bit of water and plenty of sun.
GUM_whow_cactus-4	Read the following steps to find out how to grow Beavertail cactus.
GUM_whow_cactus-5	Method 1 of 2: From Seeds
GUM_whow_cactus-6	Purchase Beavertail cactus seeds.
GUM_whow_cactus-7	These can be bought at garden centers or purchased online.
GUM_whow_cactus-8	Scatter the seeds.
GUM_whow_cactus-9	In a shady garden bed, simply scatter the seeds on the soil.
GUM_whow_cactus-10	There's no need to cover them, unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off.
GUM_whow_cactus-11	Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate.
GUM_whow_cactus-12	Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade.
GUM_whow_cactus-13	Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow, whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight.
GUM_whow_cactus-14	Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting.
GUM_whow_cactus-15	It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers.
GUM_whow_cactus-16	Method 2 of 2: From Cuttings
GUM_whow_cactus-17	Obtain Beavertail cuttings.
GUM_whow_cactus-18	You can purchase them online or at a local garden center.
GUM_whow_cactus-19	If you already own a Beavertail cactus, you can make your own cuttings.
GUM_whow_cactus-20	To do this, choose pads (the flat, oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base.
GUM_whow_cactus-21	In order to form a callous and prevent rot, cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry, dark place for 10 to 14 days.
GUM_whow_cactus-22	Plant the cuttings.
GUM_whow_cactus-23	Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it.
GUM_whow_cactus-24	Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage.
GUM_whow_cactus-25	Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch (2.5 cm.) deep.
GUM_whow_cactus-26	If you plant the cuttings too deep, they might rot.
GUM_whow_cactus-27	Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place.
GUM_whow_cactus-28	Choose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttings.
GUM_whow_cactus-29	If you live in an area with strong summer sun, position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south.
GUM_whow_cactus-30	This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day.
GUM_whow_cactus-31	Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds.
GUM_whow_cactus-32	Wait for a month.
GUM_whow_cactus-33	Do not water the cutting for the first month.
GUM_whow_cactus-34	The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow.
GUM_whow_cactus-35	Too much water might cause rot.
GUM_whow_cactus-36	After 1 month, roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time.
GUM_whow_cactus-37	Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings.
GUM_whow_cactus-38	Once fully rooted, they are extremely drought resistant.
GUM_whow_cactus-39	Fertilize the plants.
GUM_whow_cactus-40	During the spring, summer, and fall, the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer.
GUM_whow_cactus-41	Let the cuttings grow.
GUM_whow_cactus-42	From the first pad, many more will form.
GUM_whow_cactus-43	The second or third pad will bear some flowers, but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests.

GUM_whow_cupcakes-44	Mix together.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-45	Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat together (by hand or with an electric hand-held mixer).
GUM_whow_cupcakes-46	Fill the muffin pan.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-47	Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-48	If you prefer larger cupcakes, then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-49	Bake for 18 - 20 minutes.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-50	If you can smell the cupcakes earlier, check to make sure they aren't browning earlier (this means they 're more than ready).
GUM_whow_cupcakes-51	If you aren't certain, turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-52	Wait for the pan to cool down.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-53	Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-54	Ice the cupcakes.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-55	The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-56	Finished.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-57	Method 2 of 2: Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes
GUM_whow_cupcakes-58	Preheat the oven to 160 oC / 315 oF.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-59	If using cupcake cases, arrange on a baking sheet now.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-60	If using a silicone cupcake sheet, simply have it ready.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-61	Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and pinch of salt to the mixing bowl.

GUM_whow_cupcakes-71	Remove from the oven.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-72	Transfer the cupcakes to a wire cooling rack as quickly as possible when cool enough to handle.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-73	Let cool completely on the rack.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-74	Frost as desired.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-75	Add standard frosting or make vegan butter cream.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-76	Tips
GUM_whow_cupcakes-77	You can add pureed fruit for delicious flavor changes.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-78	One small container of pureed fruit is sufficient for flavoring (the little containers that children take to school in their lunchboxes.)
GUM_whow_cupcakes-79	Try strawberry, apple, banana, apricot, peach etc.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-80	The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy, however, so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-81	Instead of using vegan sugar, you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup
GUM_whow_cupcakes-82	Instead of using vegetable oil, try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-83	Coconut oil also produces good results.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-84	And olive oil works fine if it's all that's left in the pantry.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-85	You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes.
GUM_whow_cupcakes-86	Experiment with the flavors of either recipe by replacing the vanilla extract with fragrant ingredients like neroli orange oil, rosewater, orange blossom water or coconut extract.
GUM_whow_mice-1	How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally
GUM_whow_mice-2	Having mice in your home is both a nuisance and a health hazard.
GUM_whow_mice-3	They can cause property damage, create a mess, and produce unpleasant smells.
GUM_whow_mice-4	In addition, repelling and removing rodents from your home can be a hassle if you don't know what you are doing.
GUM_whow_mice-5	It can also be dangerous if you use toxic chemicals and poisons.
GUM_whow_mice-6	It's a good thing, then, that there are some simple ways to effectively get mice out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisons.
GUM_whow_mice-7	Method 1 Discouraging Mice Naturally
GUM_whow_mice-8	Keep your home clean.
GUM_whow_mice-9	Many times mice are drawn into homes on the search for food.
GUM_whow_mice-10	If there is nothing to eat, mice will be less likely to stay.
GUM_whow_mice-11	Keep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack. [1]
GUM_whow_mice-12	Apply peppermint oil.
GUM_whow_mice-13	Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent.
GUM_whow_mice-14	The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it.
GUM_whow_mice-15	It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning.
GUM_whow_mice-16	It also gives the house a lovely smell, and is not toxic, unlike many synthetic chemical treatments.
GUM_whow_mice-17	You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores. [2]
GUM_whow_mice-18	Place a drop or two on a cotton ball.
GUM_whow_mice-19	Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it.
GUM_whow_mice-20	Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house, by doorways, or heat vents, etc.
GUM_whow_mice-21	Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5 - 7 days, depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it.
GUM_whow_mice-22	Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways.
GUM_whow_mice-23	You can use the mint in cooking, as well as it serving a deterrent purpose.
GUM_whow_mice-24	Use dried snake feces.
GUM_whow_mice-25	Visit a local reptile center, zoo, or pet store and ask for some dried snake poo.
GUM_whow_mice-26	You can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake.
GUM_whow_mice-27	Place near entrances and in places where mice seem to go.
GUM_whow_mice-28	This will keep mice away. [3]
GUM_whow_mice-29	Be sure to keep the feces out of the reach of children and pets.
GUM_whow_mice-30	Zap mice with ultrasonic sounds.
GUM_whow_mice-31	There are electronic units sold that emit an ultrasonic beeping sound that rodents hate.
GUM_whow_mice-32	They should be available at your local home improvement store or online.
GUM_whow_mice-33	These work only on a single line of sight, so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking.
GUM_whow_mice-34	The units may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them. [4]
GUM_whow_mice-35	Use a commercial, organic deterrent.
GUM_whow_mice-36	Many companies that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons.
GUM_whow_mice-37	Many of these products use natural ingredients, such as peppermint, that are known to be disagreeable to mice.
GUM_whow_mice-38	They will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied.
GUM_whow_mice-39	These products should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center.
GUM_whow_mice-40	If you want a specific product, try doing a online search to see where it is available locally.
GUM_whow_mice-41	Get a cat.
GUM_whow_mice-42	A house cat can take care of the problem.
GUM_whow_mice-43	Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse.
GUM_whow_mice-44	Just be aware, not all cats have enough energy, interest or training to hunt mice.
GUM_whow_mice-45	Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser.
GUM_whow_mice-46	Well-food indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy, and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless.
GUM_whow_mice-47	Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter, and generally do not test for this.
GUM_whow_mice-48	Sometimes this information is available, but usually not.
GUM_whow_mice-49	While many mousers are great pets as well, not all are.
GUM_whow_mice-50	"Barn cats" may not be socialized well with humans, although used to hunting mice for food.
GUM_whow_mice-51	Even if you do not have a cat, you can use used kitty litter to deter mice.
GUM_whow_mice-52	Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house.
GUM_whow_mice-53	The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy.
GUM_whow_mice-54	If you have a large infestation, a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it.
GUM_whow_mice-55	However, once you eliminate the infestation, a cat will probably prevent reinfestation. [5]
GUM_whow_mice-56	Put your trash cans far from your home.
GUM_whow_mice-57	Mice smell garbage and get attracted to your house.
GUM_whow_mice-58	If you keep the cans away from the house, they are less likely to take up residence in your home.
GUM_whow_mice-59	Promote the nesting of birds of prey in your yard.
GUM_whow_mice-60	Build a shelter box in your garden to attract some onto your property.
GUM_whow_mice-61	This may take some time, but it's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard. [6]
GUM_whow_mice-62	Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards.
GUM_whow_mice-63	A barn owl is the best.
GUM_whow_mice-64	A family of barn owls can eat many mice in a night!
GUM_whow_mice-65	However, you might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box.

GUM_academic_art-7	How do people look at and experience art?
GUM_academic_art-8	Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on?
GUM_academic_art-9	Do museum labels have an impact on how people look at artworks?
GUM_academic_art-10	The viewing experience of art is a complex one, involving issues of perception, attention, memory, decision-making, affect, and emotion.
GUM_academic_art-11	Thus, the time it takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork can inform about its relevance, interestingness, and even its aesthetic appeal.
GUM_academic_art-12	This paper describes a collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbarán paintings.
GUM_academic_art-13	The Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection preserved in situ in purpose-built surroundings.
GUM_academic_art-14	While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics, no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes.
GUM_academic_art-15	In this paper, we report upon the novel insights eye-tracking techniques have provided into the unconscious processes of viewing the unique collection of Zurbarán artworks.
GUM_academic_art-16	The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks.
GUM_academic_art-17	We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice.
GUM_academic_art-18	The project brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history, experimental psychology, digital humanities, and museum studies to explore, using eye-tracking techniques, aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbarán artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole.
GUM_academic_art-19	Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork.
GUM_academic_art-20	When regarding an artwork, a viewer gathers information through a series fixations, interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades.
GUM_academic_art-21	The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene (e.g. colour, texture, brightness etc).
GUM_academic_art-22	Importantly, studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants’ beliefs, memories or subjective impressions of the artwork.
GUM_academic_art-23	Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts (see for example Brieber 2014; Binderman et al., 2005) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit (Filippini Fantoni et al., 2013; Heidenreich & Turano 2011; Milekic 2010).
GUM_academic_art-24	Zurbarán’s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years.
GUM_academic_art-25	It is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the UK, and one of very few of its kind in the world.
GUM_academic_art-26	It has a long history in scholarship (Baron & Beresford 2014), but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood.
GUM_academic_art-27	In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham, of which the 13 Zurbarán artworks (there are actually only 12 Zurbarán artworks, the 13th Benjamin, is a copy by Arthur Pond) are a key part of, to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art, how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways.
GUM_academic_art-28	This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit, namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour.
GUM_academic_census-1	1 Introduction
GUM_academic_census-2	Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress, both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers.
GUM_academic_census-3	Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity, including ethnic, racial, and gender diversity.
GUM_academic_census-4	As an example, research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [1] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [2, 3] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers.
GUM_academic_census-5	Additionally, diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [4], which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists.
GUM_academic_census-6	Despite these positive effects, however, quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult, due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce.
GUM_academic_census-7	Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce, particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science, is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced.
GUM_academic_census-8	For many scientific fields, however, there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty, making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis.
GUM_academic_census-9	Further, rates of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within, and across disciplines.
GUM_academic_census-10	For instance, gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [5], but without a full census of computing faculty, the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [6].
GUM_academic_census-11	Some disciplines, like political science, are organized around a single professional society, whose membership roll approximates a full census [7].
GUM_academic_census-12	Most fields, on the other hand, including computer science, lack a single all-encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists, such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments.
GUM_academic_census-13	Because assembling such a full census is difficult, past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [8 – 11], usually specific to a particular field [12 – 16], and often focused on the scientific elite [17, 18].
GUM_academic_census-14	Although useful, such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability.
GUM_academic_census-15	One of the largest census efforts to date assembled, by hand, a nearly complete record of three academic fields: computer science, history, and business [19].
GUM_academic_census-16	This data set has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training, placement, and scholarly productivity [6, 19, 20].
GUM_academic_census-17	But, this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields.
GUM_academic_census-18	In some fields, yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate.
GUM_academic_census-19	In computer science, the Computing Research Association (CRA) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America (cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey).
GUM_academic_census-20	Such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses.
GUM_academic_census-21	First, surveys are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames, which can inject bias into fine-grained analyses [21, 22].
GUM_academic_census-22	Second, aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field, which can make it difficult to investigate causality [23].
GUM_academic_census-23	For example, differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging, thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies.
GUM_academic_census-24	Here, we present a novel system, based on a topical web crawler, that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web.
GUM_academic_census-25	This system is efficient and accurate, and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection.
GUM_academic_census-26	The system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours using off-the-shelf computing hardware, a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [19].
GUM_academic_census-27	By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone, this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings, without having to rely on surveys or professional societies.
GUM_academic_census-28	This system can also be used longitudinally to study how the workforce’s composition changes over time, which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty.
GUM_academic_census-29	Finally, applied to many academic fields in parallel, the system can elucidate scientists’ movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances.
GUM_academic_census-30	In short, many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data.
GUM_academic_census-31	Our study is organized as follows.
GUM_academic_census-32	We begin by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework.
GUM_academic_census-33	Next, we present the results of our work in two sections.
GUM_academic_census-34	The first demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler by collecting census data for the field of computer science and comparing it to a hand-curated census, collected in 2011 [19].
GUM_academic_census-35	The second provides an example of the type of research enabled by our system and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses to investigate the “leaky pipeline” problem in faculty retention.
GUM_academic_epistemic-1	Epistemic pollution
GUM_academic_epistemic-2	Agents can rationally choose between experts only if the criteria that distinguish genuine experts from charlatans are common sense or widely known:
GUM_academic_epistemic-3	if agents are to satisfy the epistemic conditions on responsibility, they must know what kinds of knowledge they must utilize to guide their selection of sources (on pain of infinite regress).
GUM_academic_epistemic-4	In fact, many, if not all, the markers of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition.
GUM_academic_epistemic-5	The fact that these criteria are widely known, however, offers an opportunity to those who would use them for deception, witting or unwitting.
GUM_academic_epistemic-6	Since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers, to mimic the markers of expertise is to mimic expertise [17].
GUM_academic_epistemic-7	We live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise.
GUM_academic_epistemic-8	This fact, together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur, reduces ordinary people’s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources.
GUM_academic_epistemic-9	For instance, those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise, taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in.
GUM_academic_epistemic-10	There are some egregious examples of this practice in the field of health care.
GUM_academic_epistemic-11	For example, a small number of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care.
GUM_academic_epistemic-12	Such an organization is surely permissible, but it has had the unfortunate (and likely intended) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large.
GUM_academic_epistemic-13	Thus, when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [21], many people mistook the organization’s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians — although the peak body for pediatric workers, the American Academy of Pediatrics, has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [22].
GUM_academic_epistemic-14	Insofar as the larger organization, with a broader membership base, can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise, it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization.
GUM_academic_epistemic-15	When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession, it introduces an epistemic pollutant.
GUM_academic_epistemic-16	A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies’ commercial products [23].
GUM_academic_epistemic-17	The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional “research” with an air of reliability.
GUM_academic_epistemic-18	When the deceit was uncovered, however, the effect was just the opposite:
GUM_academic_epistemic-19	the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier, but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier’s publications — and, by extension, all academic journals — was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research.
GUM_academic_epistemic-20	More recently, institutions of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so-called predatory journals — journals that will publish almost anything for a fee.
GUM_academic_epistemic-21	Once again, this phenomenon has the effect of making peer-reviewed journals appear less legitimate.
GUM_academic_epistemic-22	At times, even those who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal’s legitimacy, and there are genuine borderline cases.
GUM_academic_epistemic-23	For example, the Frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate — at least to me — despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee. 8
GUM_academic_epistemic-24	Yet some Frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior, whether for profit or for some other motive.
GUM_academic_epistemic-25	Frontiers in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [24] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [25].
GUM_academic_epistemic-26	Whether due to this behavior or not, Jeffrey Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential (but now sadly unavailable) list of questionable journals [26].
GUM_academic_epistemic-27	The controversy surrounding Beall’s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments — even for professionals.
GUM_academic_epistemic-28	If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate, one can notreasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments.
GUM_academic_epistemic-29	If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution, one can hardly blame them.
GUM_academic_epistemic-30	Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise, it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions.
GUM_academic_epistemic-31	Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions. 9
GUM_academic_epistemic-32	For example, pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise.
GUM_academic_epistemic-33	Consider institutions with a credentialing function, such as universities, bar associations, or peer review bodies.
GUM_academic_epistemic-34	These institutions do not exist solely to credential experts.
GUM_academic_epistemic-35	They have other functions, and these functions may come into conflict, creating pressures to inflate credentials.
GUM_academic_epistemic-36	For example, universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff, thereby increasing their rankings, bringing in grant money, and attracting students.
GUM_academic_epistemic-37	Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated, and many cases of such manipulation exist — take the recent example by the University of Malaysia, which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [28].
GUM_academic_epistemic-38	For this reason, institutions may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud, and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house to protect their reputations.
GUM_academic_games-1	The Use of Cognitive Digital Games in School:
GUM_academic_games-2	Contributions to Attention
GUM_academic_games-3	Daniela Karine Ramos dadaniela@gmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin
GUM_academic_games-4	Bruna Anastacio brunaanastacio@hotmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin
GUM_academic_games-5	Cognitive games involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition, while proposing the intersection between the sets of concepts, fun and cognition, for the improvement of cognitive functions.
GUM_academic_games-6	The attention is the main point made in this study, since it is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools.
GUM_academic_games-7	With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes, researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills (Li, Polat, Scalzo, & Bavelier, 2010); on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously (Dye & Bavelier, 2010; Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007); and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, & Gratton, 2008).
GUM_academic_games-8	Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student's attention span at preschool age (Rueda, Checa, & Cómbita, 2012), to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children (Miller & Robertson, 2010), and to better performance of working memory ability (Klingberg et al., 2005; Thorell, Lindqvist, Nutley, Bohlin, & Klingberg, 2009).
GUM_academic_games-9	Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention, because of its involvement in the regulation of thoughts and emotions, maintaining the performance of this process is very important, especially in school, where the child must acquire content in an environment full of countless distractors.
GUM_academic_games-10	The study in question focuses on the attention, proposing and evaluation in the context of the classroom.
GUM_academic_games-11	Thus, it suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom.
GUM_academic_games-12	The games have features like increasing challenges, rules that establish what can and can notbe done, and involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills and win the game (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2004; Prensky, 2005).
GUM_academic_games-13	We aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a database, of the Escola do Cérebro, for monitoring and improvement of cognitive skills, highlighting the attention.
GUM_academic_games-14	The games involve challenges and rules involving the exercise of cognitive functions, especially the working memory, attention and capacity of solving problems.
GUM_academic_games-15	The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches.
GUM_academic_games-16	It collects the data based on the observation of the proposed interventions as well as interviews conducted with participating teachers and students to identify their perceptions of digital games’ contributions to the learning process.
GUM_academic_games-17	Furthermore, before and after the implementation of the intervention, we performed a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention, as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed.
GUM_academic_games-18	The intervention consisted in the use of the Escola do Cérebro, using tablets in the classroom, daily for a period of five weeks.
GUM_academic_games-19	The sample consisted of 71 students of the Application School of Basic Education, Federal University of Santa Catarina, aged 7 and 9 years old (M = 7.64 ± 1.12), which were divided into two groups: participant and control.
GUM_academic_games-20	The first (n = 31) participated in the intervention, the control group (n = 40) was only evaluated using the test before and after the same time interval of interventions.
GUM_academic_games-21	The Escola do Cérebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database.
GUM_academic_games-22	The application allows visualization of the player's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers.
GUM_academic_games-23	Students have their scores measured by four variables: time, speed, stability and accuracy.
GUM_academic_games-24	A statistical analysis was performed based on the application of the paired t-test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups.
GUM_academic_games-25	The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant (p < 0.05),
GUM_academic_games-26	the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 (64.75) respectively, while the control group was 20.00 (42.65).
GUM_academic_games-27	The result indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test, as well as a high dispersion, which reveals a variation in relation to the performance.
GUM_academic_games-28	In addition, students participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem solving, recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities, and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention.
GUM_academic_games-29	The teachers observed changes after the intervention, emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities, and in some students, improvement in the ability to sustain attention.
GUM_academic_games-30	From this, we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention.
GUM_academic_implicature-1	4. Discussion.
GUM_academic_implicature-2	We hypothesized that the children, who were over the age of six at the time of collection, would have adult-like SI interpretations.
GUM_academic_implicature-3	We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments, and would result in adult-like interpretations.
GUM_academic_implicature-4	Further, we posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported, and in fact there was some non-adult-like performance, that there would be significant variability among the conditions, with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest.
GUM_academic_implicature-5	On the surface, it does seem as if there is variability and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding (see limitations below), but at least for this study, the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some.
GUM_academic_implicature-6	Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some.
GUM_academic_implicature-7	4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS.
GUM_academic_implicature-8	This study is limited in its power and generalizability.
GUM_academic_implicature-9	It serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally.
GUM_academic_implicature-10	Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them.
GUM_academic_implicature-11	Future studies need to include more participants and more items to increase power.
GUM_academic_implicature-12	Future studies should also include a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges.
GUM_academic_implicature-13	Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power, but interesting trends (e.g., Nedwick, 2014).
GUM_academic_implicature-14	Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed.
GUM_academic_implicature-15	In a future study, it is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results, or if more naturalistic experimental conditions (e.g., demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions) would be beneficial.
GUM_academic_implicature-16	Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior (Hein, Reich, Marks, Thuma, & Grigorenko, 2016).
GUM_academic_implicature-17	The current study is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods;
GUM_academic_implicature-18	however, in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type.
GUM_academic_implicature-19	In the current study, the responses from two children were not included because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items.
GUM_academic_implicature-20	More specifically, they answered “yes” that the puppet described the pictures well.
GUM_academic_implicature-21	It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions, and in this regard, are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations.
GUM_academic_implicature-22	This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well.
GUM_academic_implicature-23	It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors, or be polite, and that “yes” was in some ways a default answer to be provided when having to respond verbally in a test context.
GUM_academic_implicature-24	Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes.
GUM_academic_implicature-25	The puppets used were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance.
GUM_academic_implicature-26	Upon arrival at the school, however, it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them.
GUM_academic_implicature-27	Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting.
GUM_academic_implicature-28	Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words while numbers greater than five are typically indicated using English borrowings.
GUM_academic_implicature-29	The cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five in order to avoid additional item variability, but larger numbers should be included in future research.
GUM_academic_implicature-30	5. Conclusion.
GUM_academic_implicature-31	Albeit limited, these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research, but appears to be completed at a later age in this language.
GUM_academic_implicature-32	This interesting combination of findings – expected hierarchy of difficulty, but differing age of acquisition – is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences.
GUM_academic_lighting-1	Utilization of busted CFL in developing cheap and efficient segmented compact LED bulbs
GUM_academic_lighting-2	N S Andres and R T Ponce
GUM_academic_lighting-3	Electrical Engineering Department, Bataan Peninsula State University, 2100, Balanga City Bataan, Philippines
GUM_academic_lighting-4	Abstract.
GUM_academic_lighting-5	Today’s generation will not survive a day without the help of lighting.
GUM_academic_lighting-6	In fact, someone’s productivity, particularly at night, depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity.
GUM_academic_lighting-7	Lighting takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines.
GUM_academic_lighting-8	There are different type of lighting bulbs used at home can affect the overall lighting consumption.
GUM_academic_lighting-9	Nowadays, most commonly and widely used bulb in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL).
GUM_academic_lighting-10	However, the main problem of CFL is the mercury they contain.
GUM_academic_lighting-11	In addition to this is the harmful effect of mercury such as Emission of UV Radiation.
GUM_academic_lighting-12	In response to the said problem, this project study gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment, health and safety as well energy conservation, by developing a segmented compact light-emitting diode (SCLED) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient, economical, and does not contain toxic chemicals.
GUM_academic_lighting-13	1. Introduction
GUM_academic_lighting-14	Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey (HECS), electricity remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines.
GUM_academic_lighting-15	About 87 percent of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011.
GUM_academic_lighting-16	As of 2016, the demand for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors.
GUM_academic_lighting-17	It is often grouped depending on its uses that are distributed for heating and cooling, lighting, operating appliances etc [1]
GUM_academic_lighting-18	Figure 1.
GUM_academic_lighting-19	January - june2016 philippine power demand
GUM_academic_lighting-20	Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity, typical homes as shown in figure 1, consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today: making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption.
GUM_academic_lighting-21	Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy; it consumes about 18% of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [2].
GUM_academic_lighting-22	Figure 2.
GUM_academic_lighting-23	Estimated electricity use in residential sector
GUM_academic_lighting-24	One of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb.
GUM_academic_lighting-25	The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage.
GUM_academic_lighting-26	There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays: the (light-emitting diode) LED bulb, (compact fluorescent light) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb.
GUM_academic_lighting-27	But each of them has their perks and perils [3].
GUM_academic_lighting-28	Unfortunately, most of the time, people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary.
GUM_academic_lighting-29	Today, CFLs are the most used lighting sources in the household.
GUM_academic_lighting-30	Using CFLs will allow people to decrease their energy consumption; also it is a good start to decrease greenhouse emissions.
GUM_academic_lighting-31	However, the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain.
GUM_academic_lighting-32	When products and wastes containing mercury are improperly disposed of, mercury is released into the air, ground or water.
GUM_academic_lighting-33	It is persistent in the environment; it never breaks down nor goes away.
GUM_academic_lighting-34	In addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation.
GUM_academic_lighting-35	This UV radiation interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light.
GUM_academic_lighting-36	The acute and chronic effects are the normal responses of the skin to UVR; acute reactions considered will be erythema (sunburn) and vitamin D production.
GUM_academic_lighting-37	Skin aging and skin cancer will be discussed as those reactions produced by prolonged or repeated UVR exposure [4].
GUM_academic_lighting-38	In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources, the proponents conducted this study.
GUM_academic_lighting-39	Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials, the proponents conducted a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb.
GUM_academic_replication-1	Replication in Second Language Research:
GUM_academic_replication-2	Narrative and Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for the Field
GUM_academic_replication-3	Replication studies are considered by many to play a fundamental role in any scientific endeavor.
GUM_academic_replication-4	When using the same materials and procedures as a previous study, replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study’s findings.
GUM_academic_replication-5	When altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study, they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions.
GUM_academic_replication-6	One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language (L2) research alone (see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online): from Santos (1989) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication studies, such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment (Porte, 2012).
GUM_academic_replication-7	Beyond these calls, efforts to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged.
GUM_academic_replication-8	For example, the Instruments for Research into Second Languages (IRIS) repository (http://www.irisdatabase.org) was established in 2011 and holds, at the time of writing, over 3,800 materials that can be used for replication, among other purposes, in L2 research (Marsden & Mackey, 2014; Marsden, Mackey, & Plonsky, 2016).
GUM_academic_replication-9	The Open Science Framework (https://osf.io), also established in 2011, provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015), which continue to make waves in academia (Laws, 2016; Lindsay, 2015; Martin & Clarke, 2017) and the general media (Baker, 2015; Devlin, 2016).
GUM_academic_replication-10	In some fields, a flourishing metascience, that is, the scientific study of science (see Munafò et al., 2017), has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts, for example, in education (Makel & Plucker, 2014 and in psychology (Makel et al., 2012).
GUM_academic_replication-11	The driving force behind this battery of calls, commentaries, infrastructure, and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research.
GUM_academic_replication-12	The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to: (a) the (small) amount of published replication research; (b) the (poor) quality of replication research; and (c) the (lack of) reproducibility, which refers to the extent to which findings can (not) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken.
GUM_academic_replication-13	These concerns speak to the very core of science, raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work.
GUM_academic_replication-14	Indeed, some commentators have called replication the “gold standard” of research evidence (Jasny, Chin, Chong, & Vignieri, 2011, p. 1225) and a “linchpin of the scientific process” (Let’s replicate, 2006, p. 330).
GUM_academic_replication-15	In the field of L2 research, given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified, one might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now.
GUM_academic_replication-16	However, a perceived lack of prestige, excitement, and originality of replication plagues L2 research (Porte, 2012), as it does other disciplines (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2017; Branco, Cohen, Vossen, Ide, & Calzolari, 2017; Chambers, 2017; Schmidt, 2009), and these perceptions are thought to have caused, at least in part (directly or indirectly), alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies.
GUM_academic_replication-17	However, a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of L2 research, leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published.
GUM_academic_replication-18	The current study begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews.
GUM_academic_replication-19	The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology, given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research, and also from education, another key sister discipline.
GUM_academic_replication-20	The narrative review is organized around four broad themes: (a) the quantity of replication research, (b) the nature of replication research, (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies, and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies.
GUM_academic_replication-21	To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research, the systematic review provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications.
GUM_academic_replication-22	The research questions and methods of the systematic review were largely determined by the narrative review but also emerged through the design and piloting of the coding instrument.
GUM_academic_replication-23	Finally, we offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite (Morgan-Short et al., 2018) 1 and single site (Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short, 2011; Marsden, Williams, & Liu, 2013; McManus & Marsden, 2017; Morgan-Short, Heil, Botero-Moriaty, & Ebert, 2012) replications.
GUM_academic_replication-24	We start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory, at least for hypothesis-testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable.
GUM_academic_replication-25	Thus, our overall aim is to provide conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies, with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research.
GUM_academic_thrones-1	Re(a)d Wedding:
GUM_academic_thrones-2	A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones
GUM_academic_thrones-3	It is no exaggeration to say that HBO’s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand:
GUM_academic_thrones-4	it is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder (1991) and popularized by Henry Jenkins (2006), in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the “storyworld” of an original production.
GUM_academic_thrones-5	Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes, with an average global viewership (from its most recent season) of 25.1 million viewers per episode (Shepherd, 2016), it has spawned five video games, a graphic novel adaptation, several companion books, two rap albums, a 28-city orchestral tour, a wide variety of tabletop games, toys, merchandise and mobile apps, and countless podcasts, fanfics and other fan-based creations.
GUM_academic_thrones-6	Given the volume of content this represents, it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom.
GUM_academic_thrones-7	As such, the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new, who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives.
GUM_academic_thrones-8	In this sense, fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored.
GUM_academic_thrones-9	Transmedia systems, like that exemplified by Game of Thrones, are becoming increasingly prevalent (e.g., Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Walking Dead, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, etc);
GUM_academic_thrones-10	these systems demonstrate, in microcosm, the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society.
GUM_academic_thrones-11	The study of how people, as fans, access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry, but to the wider context of cultural studies, by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user.
GUM_academic_thrones-12	For us, as digital humanists, defining the “transmedia fan” is of particular relevance as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies.
GUM_academic_thrones-13	Methodology
GUM_academic_thrones-14	As a first step in defining the “transmedia fan”, the current project undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans.
GUM_academic_thrones-15	One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material (Martin, 2000) was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season, “The Rains of Castamere” (Benioff & Weiss, 2013).
GUM_academic_thrones-16	Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the “Red Wedding”, while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin’s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode.
GUM_academic_thrones-17	Since the television series’ inception, writers at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode:
GUM_academic_thrones-18	one for viewers familiar with the books (i.e., “Experts”) and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books and averse to “spoilers” (i.e., “Newbies”).
GUM_academic_thrones-19	What results are two completely separate reviews of “The Rains of Castamere” which in turn document the fans’ reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads:
GUM_academic_thrones-20	one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it.
GUM_academic_thrones-21	As a pilot project, the current work takes the content of both comment threads — a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments — and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006).
GUM_academic_thrones-22	Through this analysis, a categorization of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans.
GUM_academic_thrones-23	These themes fall under two broad categories:
GUM_academic_thrones-24	negotiation (i.e., emotional responses) and tactical negotiation (i.e., cognitive, or reasoned responses).
GUM_academic_thrones-25	A comparison of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings to support an emergent model, or models, of the “transmedia fan”.
GUM_academic_thrones-26	Conclusion
GUM_academic_thrones-27	The present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems, as exemplified by Game of Thrones, through the study of fans.
GUM_academic_thrones-28	The question posed by this research is, fundamentally, an examination of how the problem of “access” is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer.
GUM_academic_thrones-29	Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau’s (1984) everyday life practice, in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers.
GUM_academic_thrones-30	The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan.
GUM_academic_thrones-31	This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies, fan studies, information studies and digital humanities.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-1	Daniel Bernoulli
GUM_bio_bernoulli-2	Daniel Bernoulli FRS (German pronunciation: [bɛʁˈnʊli]; 8 February 1700 – 17 March 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-3	He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-4	His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli's principle, a particular example of the conservation of energy, which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the carburetor and the airplane wing.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-5	Daniel Bernoulli
GUM_bio_bernoulli-6	Early life
GUM_bio_bernoulli-7	Frontpage of Hydrodynamica (1738)
GUM_bio_bernoulli-8	Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen, in the Netherlands, into a family of distinguished mathematicians.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-9	The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp, at that time in the Spanish Netherlands, but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Huguenots.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-10	After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel, in Switzerland.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-11	Daniel was a son of Johann Bernoulli (one of the "early developers" of calculus) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli (who" was the first to discover the theory of probability").
GUM_bio_bernoulli-12	He had two brothers, Niklaus and Johann II.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-13	Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as "by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis".
GUM_bio_bernoulli-14	He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-15	Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris, Johann, unable to bear the "shame" of being compared Daniel's equal, banned Daniel from his house.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-16	Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-17	Despite Daniel's attempts at reconciliation, his father carried the grudge until his death.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-18	Around schooling age, his father, Johann, encouraged him to study business, there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-19	However, Daniel refused, because he wanted to study mathematics.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-20	He later gave in to his father's wish and studied business.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-21	His father then asked him to study in medicine, and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately, which they continued for some time.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-22	Daniel studied medicine at Basel, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg, and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-23	He was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-24	He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics, but was very unhappy there, and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-25	He returned to the University of Basel, where he successively held the chairs of medicine, metaphysics, and natural philosophy until his death.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-26	In May, 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-27	Mathematical work
GUM_bio_bernoulli-28	His earliest mathematical work was the Exercitationes (Mathematical Exercises), published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-29	Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-30	His chief work is Hydrodynamica, published in 1738;
GUM_bio_bernoulli-31	it resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange's Mécanique Analytique in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle, namely, conservation of energy.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-32	This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides, to which, conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and Colin Maclaurin, a prize was awarded by the French Academy: these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and the investigations of Pierre-Simon Laplace.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-33	Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions, especially on problems connected with vibrating strings, and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-34	Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-35	In particular, they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-36	To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-37	Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-38	It was not until about 170 years later, in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-39	However, Bernoulli's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane; that is its air speed.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-40	Taking his discoveries further, Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-41	It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-42	Daniel realised that in a similar way, a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-43	Mathematically this law is now written: ½ ρ u 2 + P = constant where P is pressure, ρ is the density of the fluid and u is its velocity.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-44	A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-45	This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases.
GUM_bio_bernoulli-46	The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing, so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing.
GUM_bio_enfant-1	Pierre Charles L'Enfant,
GUM_bio_enfant-2	Pierre Charles L'Enfant (French: [pjɛʁ ʃɑʁl lɑ̃fɑ̃]; August 2, 1754 – June 14, 1825), self-identified as Peter Charles L'Enfant while living in the United States, was a French-born American military engineer who designed the basic plan for Washington, D.C. (capital city of the U.S.) known today as the L'Enfant Plan (1791).
GUM_bio_enfant-3	Early life and education
GUM_bio_enfant-4	L'Enfant was born in Paris, France on August 2, 1754, the third child and second son of Pierre L'Enfant (1704 – 1787), a painter with a good reputation in the service of King Louis XV of France, (1710 - 1774, reigned 1715 - 1774), and Marie L'Enfant, the daughter of a minor official at court.
GUM_bio_enfant-5	In 1758, his brother Pierre Joseph died at the age of six, and Pierre Charles became the eldest son.
GUM_bio_enfant-6	He studied art at the Royal Academy in the Louvre, as well as with his father at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.
GUM_bio_enfant-7	He left school in France to enlist in the American Revolutionary War on the side of the rebelling colonials.
GUM_bio_enfant-8	Military service
GUM_bio_enfant-9	L'Enfant was recruited by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais to serve in the American Revolutionary War in the United States.
GUM_bio_enfant-10	He arrived in 1777 at the age of 23, and served as a military engineer in the Continental Army with Major General Lafayette.
GUM_bio_enfant-11	He was commissioned as a captain in the Corps of Engineers on April 3, 1779 to rank from February 18, 1778.
GUM_bio_enfant-12	Despite his aristocratic origins, L'Enfant closely identified with the United States, changing his first name from Pierre to Peter when he first came to the rebelling colonies in 1777.
GUM_bio_enfant-13	L'Enfant served on General George Washington's staff at Valley Forge.
GUM_bio_enfant-14	While there, the Marquis de Lafayette commissioned L'Enfant to paint a portrait of Washington.
GUM_bio_enfant-15	He was wounded at the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779.
GUM_bio_enfant-16	He recovered and became a prisoner of war at surrender of Charleston, South Carolina on May 12, 1780.
GUM_bio_enfant-17	He was exchanged in November 1780 and served on General George Washington's staff for the remainder of the American Revolution.
GUM_bio_enfant-18	L'Enfant was promoted by brevet to Major in the Corps of Engineers on May 2, 1783, in recognition of his service to the cause of American liberty.
GUM_bio_enfant-19	He was discharged when the Continental Army was disbanded in December 1783.
GUM_bio_enfant-20	After the war, L'Enfant designed the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of former officers of the Continental Army, shaped as an eagle, at the request of Washington.
GUM_bio_enfant-21	He was sent to France to have insignias made for members of the Society, a group of veterans of the war.
GUM_bio_enfant-22	Career
GUM_bio_enfant-23	Post–Revolutionary War
GUM_bio_enfant-24	Following the American Revolutionary War, L'Enfant established a successful and highly profitable civil engineering firm in New York City.
GUM_bio_enfant-25	He achieved some fame as an architect by redesigning the City Hall in New York for the First Congress of the United States (See: Federal Hall).
GUM_bio_enfant-26	He also designed furniture and houses for the wealthy as well as coins and medals, including the insignia of the Society of the Cincinnati.
GUM_bio_enfant-27	He was also a friend of Alexander Hamilton, and some of their correspondances from 1790 to 1801 now reside in the National Archives.
GUM_bio_enfant-28	While L'Enfant was in New York City, he was initiated into Freemasonry.
GUM_bio_enfant-29	His initiation took place on April 17, 1789, at Holland Lodge No. 8, F&AM, which the Grand Lodge of New York F&AM had chartered in 1787.
GUM_bio_enfant-30	L'Enfant took only the first of three degrees offered by the Lodge and did not progress further in Freemasonry.
GUM_bio_galois-1	Final days
GUM_bio_galois-2	Siméon Poisson reviewed Galois' paper on equation theory and declared it "incomprehensible".
GUM_bio_galois-3	Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities.
GUM_bio_galois-4	After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. [4] [7]
GUM_bio_galois-5	Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831.
GUM_bio_galois-6	Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work "incomprehensible", declaring that "[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: "We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion." [16]
GUM_bio_galois-7	While Poisson's report was made before Galois' July 14 arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison.
GUM_bio_galois-8	It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier.
GUM_bio_galois-9	Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832, [12] after which he was somehow talked into a duel. [8]
GUM_bio_galois-10	Galois' fatal duel took place on 30 May. [17]
GUM_bio_galois-11	The true motives behind the duel are obscure.
GUM_bio_galois-12	There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it.
GUM_bio_galois-13	What is known is that five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair. [7]
GUM_bio_galois-14	Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel, [18] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life.
GUM_bio_galois-15	Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. [19]
GUM_bio_galois-16	The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf.
GUM_bio_galois-17	This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died.
GUM_bio_galois-18	Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois "found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé, each of whom provoked the duel."
GUM_bio_galois-19	Galois himself famously exclaimed: "I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes." [12]
GUM_bio_galois-20	Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois' biographers (most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy. [14]
GUM_bio_galois-21	As to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville, [13] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois' first arrest. [20]
GUM_bio_galois-22	However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved.
GUM_bio_galois-23	It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel's "supposed fiancé" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture.
GUM_bio_galois-24	On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials "L. D.") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois' Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. [21]
GUM_bio_galois-25	Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.
GUM_bio_galois-26	Whatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. [22]
GUM_bio_galois-27	Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, "This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind."
GUM_bio_galois-28	However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. [7]
GUM_bio_galois-29	In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.
GUM_bio_galois-30	The Galois memorial in the cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine.
GUM_bio_galois-31	Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave and the exact location is still unknown.
GUM_bio_galois-32	Early in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the abdomen, [17] abandoned by his opponents and seconds, and was found by a passing farmer.
GUM_bio_galois-33	He died the following morning [17] at ten o'clock in the Hôpital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest.
GUM_bio_galois-34	His funeral ended in riots. [17]
GUM_bio_galois-35	There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque's death, and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June.
GUM_bio_galois-36	Only Galois' younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois' death. [23]
GUM_bio_galois-37	He was 20 years old.
GUM_bio_galois-38	His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:
GUM_bio_galois-39	“Ne pleure pas, Alfred!
GUM_bio_galois-40	J' ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir à vingt ans!”
GUM_bio_galois-41	(Don't cry, Alfred!
GUM_bio_galois-42	I need all my courage to die at twenty!)
GUM_bio_galois-43	On 2 June, Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown. [17] [15]
GUM_bio_galois-44	In the cemetery of his native town – Bourg-la-Reine – a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives. [24]
GUM_bio_gordon-1	A bust of Patrick Gordon in Yekaterinburg, Russia
GUM_bio_gordon-2	Patrick Leopold Gordon of Auchleuchries (31 March 1635 in Auchleuchries, Aberdeenshire, Scotland – 29 November 1699 in Moscow, Russia) was a general and rear admiral in Russia, of Scottish origin.
GUM_bio_gordon-3	He was descended from a family of Aberdeenshire, holders of the small estate of Auchleuchries, near Ellon.
GUM_bio_gordon-4	The family was connected with the noble branch of Haddo.
GUM_bio_gordon-5	As a result of his distinguished service for Sweden, Poland and Russia he rose in ranks from trooper to full general, and became principal advisor and close friend of Tsar Peter the Great.
GUM_bio_gordon-6	Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death.
GUM_bio_gordon-7	Life
GUM_bio_gordon-8	Gordon was brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic, at a time when the Church was being persecuted in Scotland, which had become Calvinist.
GUM_bio_gordon-9	After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, at age of fifteen he entered the Jesuit college at Braunsberg, East Prussia, then part of Poland; however, his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school, and he soon decided to return home.
GUM_bio_gordon-10	He changed his mind, however, before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland, and after journeying on foot in several parts of what is today Germany, in 1655 he enlisted at Hamburg into the military service of Sweden.
GUM_bio_gordon-11	In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both.
GUM_bio_gordon-12	At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660, Gordon was wounded. [1]
GUM_bio_gordon-13	Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration, Gordon left the Polish service, but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England. [1]
GUM_bio_gordon-14	In 1661, after further experiences as a soldier of fortune, he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I, and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England.
GUM_bio_gordon-15	After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia.
GUM_bio_gordon-16	Gordon disliked the Russian service, complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials, which left him, in his own words, "almost at witsend with vexation". [2]
GUM_bio_gordon-17	However, in recognition of his service he was promoted to major-general in 1678, was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679, and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general.
GUM_bio_gordon-18	He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar's service; his fellow-Scots Paul Menzies and Alexander Livingston also found themselves in Russia fleeing religious intolerance or seeking adventure.
GUM_bio_gordon-19	Gordon visited England and Scotland in 1686.
GUM_bio_gordon-20	In 1687 and 1689 he took part in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea, being made a full general.
GUM_bio_gordon-21	Later in 1689 a revolution broke out in Moscow, and with the troops under his command Gordon virtually decided events in favour of Peter the Great, [3] and against the Regent, Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna.
GUM_bio_gordon-22	Consequently, he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar, who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia.
GUM_bio_gordon-23	In 1696, Gordon's design of a "moveable rampart" played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov. [3]
GUM_bio_gordon-24	Gordon's alleged tomb at Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow.
GUM_bio_gordon-25	One of Gordon's greatest achievements was securing permission from the Tsars to establish the first Roman Catholic church and school in Muscovy, of which he remained the main benefactor, and headed the Catholic community in Russia until his death.
GUM_bio_gordon-26	For his services his second son James, brigadier of the Russian army, was created Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701.
GUM_bio_gordon-27	The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the West European system; and raised him to the rank of full general.
GUM_bio_gordon-28	At the end of his life the Tsar, who had visited Gordon frequently during his illness, was with him when he died, and with his own hands closed his eyes.
GUM_bio_gordon-29	Originally buried in the Foreign Quarter, his remains were reinterred at Azov in 1877, with an inscription in German which mistakenly gives his rank as Oberst, Colonel.
GUM_bio_gordon-30	General Gordon left behind him a uniquely detailed diary of his life and times, written in English.
GUM_bio_gordon-31	This is preserved in manuscript in the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow.
GUM_bio_gordon-32	An incomplete and faulty German translation, edited by Dr Moritz Posselt (Tagebuch des Generals Patrick Gordon) was published, the first volume at Moscow in 1849, the second at St Petersburg in 1851, and the third at St Petersburg in 1853; and Passages from the Diary of General Patrick Gordon of Auchleuchries (1635 – 1699), was printed, under the editorship of Joseph Robertson, for the Spalding Club, at Aberdeen, Scotland, 1859.
GUM_bio_gordon-33	A new full scholarly edition of Gordon's Diary in English was published by the Centre for Irish and Scottish Studies in Aberdeen (6 vols, 2009 - 2016), as well as its translation into Russian.
GUM_bio_gordon-34	His daughter was married firstly to the German-Russian Colonel Rudolf Strasburgh, and then from 1699 or 1700 to his kinsman in the Russian service Alexander Gordon of Auchintoul, author of "The History of Peter the Great, Emperor of Russia".
GUM_bio_gordon-35	She lived until 1739. [4]
GUM_bio_hadid-1	Zaha Hadid
GUM_bio_hadid-2	Dame Zaha Mohammad Hadid DBE RA (Arabic: زها حديد Zahā Ḥadīd; 31 October 1950 – 31 March 2016) was an Iraqi-British architect.
GUM_bio_hadid-3	She was the first woman to receive the Pritzker Architecture Prize, in 2004.
GUM_bio_hadid-4	She received the UK's most prestigious architectural award, the Stirling Prize, in 2010 and 2011.
GUM_bio_hadid-5	In 2012, she was made a Dame by Elizabeth II for services to architecture, and in 2015 she became the first and only woman to be awarded the Royal Gold Medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects.
GUM_bio_hadid-6	She was described by The Guardian of London as the 'Queen of the curve', who "liberated architectural geometry, giving it a whole new expressive identity. "
GUM_bio_hadid-7	Her major works include the aquatic centre for the London 2012 Olympics, Michigan State University's Broad Art Museum in the US, and the Guangzhou Opera House in China.
GUM_bio_hadid-8	Some of her designs have been presented posthumously, including the statuette for the 2017 Brit Awards, and many of her buildings are still under construction, including the Al Wakrah Stadium in Qatar, a venue for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
GUM_bio_hadid-9	Early life and academic career
GUM_bio_hadid-10	Hadid was born on 31 October 1950 in Baghdad, Iraq, to an upper-class Iraqi family.
GUM_bio_hadid-11	Her father Mohammed Hadid Muhammad al-Hajj Husayn Hadid was a wealthy industrialist from Mosul.
GUM_bio_hadid-12	He co-founded the left-liberal al-Ahali group in 1932, a significant political organisation in the 1930s and 1940s.
GUM_bio_hadid-13	He was the co-founder of the National Democratic Party in Iraq.
GUM_bio_hadid-14	He served as minister of finance after the overthrow of the monarch after the 1958 Iraqi coup d'état for the government of General Abd al-Karim Qasim.
GUM_bio_hadid-15	Her mother Wajiha al-Sabunji was an artist from Mosul.
GUM_bio_hadid-16	In the 1960s Hadid attended boarding schools in England and Switzerland.
GUM_bio_hadid-17	Hadid studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut before moving, in 1972, to London to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture.
GUM_bio_hadid-18	There she studied with Rem Koolhaas, Elia Zenghelis and Bernard Tschumi.
GUM_bio_hadid-19	Her former professor, Koolhaas, described her at graduation as "a planet in her own orbit."
GUM_bio_hadid-20	Zenghelis described her as the most outstanding pupil he ever taught.
GUM_bio_hadid-21	"We called her the inventor of the 89 degrees.
GUM_bio_hadid-22	Nothing was ever at 90 degrees.
GUM_bio_hadid-23	She had spectacular vision.
GUM_bio_hadid-24	All the buildings were exploding into tiny little pieces."
GUM_bio_hadid-25	He recalled that she was less interested in details, such as staircases.
GUM_bio_hadid-26	" The way she drew a staircase you would smash your head against the ceiling, and the space was reducing and reducing, and you would end up in the upper corner of the ceiling.
GUM_bio_hadid-27	She couldn’t care about tiny details.
GUM_bio_hadid-28	Her mind was on the broader pictures —
GUM_bio_hadid-29	when it came to the joinery she knew we could fix that later.
GUM_bio_hadid-30	She was right.’
GUM_bio_hadid-31	Her fourth-year student project was a painting of a hotel in the form of a bridge, inspired by the works of the Russian suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich
GUM_bio_higuchi-1	Ichiyō Higuchi
GUM_bio_higuchi-2	Ichiyō Higuchi (樋口 一葉 Higuchi Ichiyō, May 2, 1872 – November 23, 1896) was a pen name of Japanese author Natsu Higuchi (樋口 奈津 Higuchi Natsu), also known as Natsuko Higuchi (樋口 夏子 Higuchi Natsuko).
GUM_bio_higuchi-3	Specializing in short stories, she was one of the first important writers to appear in the Meiji period (1868 - 1912) and Japan's first prominent woman writer of modern times.
GUM_bio_higuchi-4	She wrote relatively little as a result of living a brief life — she died at 24 — but her stories had a large impact on Japanese literature and she is still appreciated by the Japanese public today.
GUM_bio_higuchi-5	Efforts to become a writer
GUM_bio_higuchi-6	She, her mother, and younger sister made ends meet by doing needlework, washing, and other jobs.
GUM_bio_higuchi-7	In 1892, after seeing the success of a classmate, Kaho Tanabe, who wrote a novel, Higuchi decided to become a novelist to support her family.
GUM_bio_higuchi-8	Nevertheless, her initial efforts at writing fiction were in the form of a short story, a form to which she would remain true.
GUM_bio_higuchi-9	In 1891 she met her future advisor who would help, she assumed, this poet-turned-fiction-writer and connect her with editors: Tosui Nakarai.
GUM_bio_higuchi-10	She fell in love with him right away, not knowing that, at 31, he had a reputation as a womanizer.
GUM_bio_higuchi-11	Nor did she realize that he wrote popular literature which aimed to please the general public and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature.
GUM_bio_higuchi-12	Her mentor did not return her passionate, if discreet, love for him, and instead treated her as a younger sister.
GUM_bio_higuchi-13	This failed relationship would become a recurrent theme in Higuchi's fiction.
GUM_bio_higuchi-14	Eventually, she got the break she was so eager for:
GUM_bio_higuchi-15	her first stories were published in a minor newspaper under her pen name, Ichiyo Higuchi.
GUM_bio_higuchi-16	The stories from this first period (1892 – 94) suffered from the excessive influence of Heian poetry.
GUM_bio_higuchi-17	Higuchi felt compelled to demonstrate her classical literary training.
GUM_bio_higuchi-18	The plots were thin, there was little development of character and they were loaded down by excessive sentiment, especially when compared to what she was writing concurrently in her diary.
GUM_bio_higuchi-19	But she was developing rapidly.
GUM_bio_higuchi-20	Several of her trademark themes appear; for example, the triangular relationship among a lonely, beautiful, young woman who has lost her parents, a handsome man who has abandoned her (and remains in the background), and a lonely and desperate ragamuffin who falls in love with her.
GUM_bio_higuchi-21	Another theme Higuchi repeated was the ambition and cruelty of the Meiji middle class.
GUM_bio_higuchi-22	The story "Umoregi" ("In Obscurity") signaled Higuchi's arrival as a professional writer.
GUM_bio_higuchi-23	It was published in the prestigious journal Miyako no Hana in 1892, only nine months after she had started writing in earnest.
GUM_bio_higuchi-24	Her work was noticed and she was recognized as a promising new author.
GUM_bio_higuchi-25	Her last years
GUM_bio_higuchi-26	In 1893, Higuchi, her mother and her sister abandoned their middle class house and, with a grim determination to survive, moved to a poor neighborhood where they opened a stationery store that before long failed.
GUM_bio_higuchi-27	Their new dwelling was a five-minute walk from Tokyo's ill-famed red-light district, the Yoshiwara.
GUM_bio_higuchi-28	Her experience living in this neighborhood would provide material for several of her later stories, especially "Takekurabe", (literally," Comparing heights"; "Child's Play" in the Robert Lyons Danly translation; also called "Growing Up" in the Edward Seidensticker translation.)
GUM_bio_higuchi-29	The stories of her mature period (1894 – 96) were not only marked by her experience living near the red-light district and greater concern over the plight of women, but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku, a 17th-century writer, whose stories she had recently discovered.
GUM_bio_higuchi-30	His distinctiveness lay in great part in his acceptance of low-life characters as worthwhile literary subjects.
GUM_bio_higuchi-31	What Higuchi added was a special awareness of suffering and sensitivity.
GUM_bio_higuchi-32	To this period belong "Ōtsugomori" ("On the Last Day of the Year"), "Nigorie" ("Troubled Waters"), "Wakare-Michi" ("Separate Ways"), "Jūsan'ya" ("The Thirteenth Night") and "Takekurabe" ("Child's Play").
GUM_bio_higuchi-33	The last two are considered her best work.
GUM_bio_higuchi-34	With these last stories her fame spread throughout the Tokyo literary establishment.
GUM_bio_higuchi-35	In her humble home she was visited by other writers, students of poetry, admirers, the curious, critics, and editors requesting her collaboration.
GUM_bio_higuchi-36	But between constant interruptions and frequent headaches, Higuchi stopped writing.
GUM_bio_higuchi-37	As her father and one of her brothers had before her, she had caught tuberculosis.
GUM_bio_higuchi-38	She died on November 23, 1896, at the age of twenty-four.
GUM_bio_higuchi-39	Higuchi's likeness adorns the Japanese 5000 yen banknote as of fall 2004, becoming the third woman to appear on a Japanese banknote, after Empress Jingū in 1881 and Murasaki Shikibu in 2000.
GUM_bio_higuchi-40	Her best-known stories have been made into movies.

GUM_bio_nida-1	Eugene Nida
GUM_bio_nida-2	Eugene A. Nida (November 11, 1914 – August 25, 2011) was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of Translation Studies.
GUM_bio_nida-3	Life
GUM_bio_nida-4	Nida was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on November 11, 1914.
GUM_bio_nida-5	He became a Christian at a young age, when he responded to the altar call at his church "to accept Christ as my Saviour."
GUM_bio_nida-6	He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California in 1936.
GUM_bio_nida-7	After graduating he attended Camp Wycliffe, where Bible translation theory was taught.
GUM_bio_nida-8	He ministered for a short time among the Tarahumara Indians in Chihuahua, Mexico, until health problems due to an inadequate diet and the high altitude forced him to leave.
GUM_bio_nida-9	Sometime in this period, Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators, a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics.
GUM_bio_nida-10	In 1937, Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California, where he obtained a master's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939.
GUM_bio_nida-11	In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana, California following the resignation of its founding pastor.
GUM_bio_nida-12	Despite his conservative background, in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical (clarification needed) in his approach.
GUM_bio_nida-13	In 1943, Nida received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan.
GUM_bio_nida-14	He was ordained as a Baptist minister.
GUM_bio_nida-15	He married Althea Lucille Sprague, who died in 1993.
GUM_bio_nida-16	In 1997, he married María Elena Fernandez-Miranda, a lawyer and diplomatic attache.
GUM_bio_nida-17	Nida retired in the early 1980s, although he continued to give lectures in universities all around the world, and lived in Alpine, Arizona, USA; Madrid, Spain and Brussels, Belgium.
GUM_bio_nida-18	He died in Madrid on August 25, 2011 aged 96.
GUM_bio_nida-19	Theories
GUM_bio_nida-20	Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics.
GUM_bio_nida-21	His Ph.D. dissertation, A Synopsis of English Syntax, was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the "immediate-constituent" theory.
GUM_bio_nida-22	His textbook Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism.
GUM_bio_nida-23	It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises.
GUM_bio_nida-24	His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence, also known as Functional Equivalence.
GUM_bio_nida-25	For more information, see "Dynamic and formal equivalence."
GUM_bio_nida-26	Nida also developed the componential analysis technique, which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation (e.g. "bachelor" = male + unmarried).
GUM_bio_nida-27	This is, perhaps, not the best example of the technique, though it is the most well-known.
GUM_bio_nida-28	Nida's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text (ST) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page, and that meaning is self-contained within the text (i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence).
GUM_bio_nida-29	This theory, along with other theories of correspondence in translating, are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence, where Nida begins by asserting that given that "no two languages are identical, either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences, it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages.
GUM_bio_nida-30	Hence, there can be no fully exact translations."
GUM_bio_nida-31	While the impact of a translation may be close to the original, there can be no identity in detail.
GUM_bio_nida-32	Nida then sets forth the differences in translation, as he would account for it, within three basic factors:
GUM_bio_nida-33	The nature of the message:
GUM_bio_nida-34	in some messages the content is of primary consideration, and in others the form must be given a higher priority.
GUM_bio_nida-35	The purpose of the author and of the translator:
GUM_bio_nida-36	to give information on both form and content;
GUM_bio_nida-37	to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he / she may understand the full implications of the message;
GUM_bio_nida-38	for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation.
GUM_bio_nida-39	The type of audience:
GUM_bio_nida-40	prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest.
GUM_bio_nida-41	Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as "identical equivalents" in translating, what one must in translating seek to do is find the "closest natural equivalent".
GUM_bio_nida-42	Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence:
GUM_bio_nida-43	Formal Equivalence (F-E) and Dynamic Equivalence (D-E).
GUM_bio_nida-44	F-E focuses attention on the message itself, in both form and content.
GUM_bio_nida-45	Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry, sentence to sentence, and concept to concept.
GUM_bio_nida-46	Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a "gloss translation" in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original.
GUM_bio_nida-47	The principles governing an F-E translation would then be: reproduction of grammatical units; consistency in word usage; and meanings in terms of the source context.
GUM_bio_theodorus-1	Theodorus of Tabennese
GUM_bio_theodorus-2	Theodorus of Tabennese (c. 314 – 368), also known as Abba Theodorus and Theodore the Sanctified was the spiritual successor to Pachomius and played a crucial role in preventing the first Christian cenobitic monastic federation from collapsing after the death of its founder.
GUM_bio_theodorus-3	Icon of St. Theodorus of Tabennese
GUM_bio_theodorus-4	Biography
GUM_bio_theodorus-5	According to hagiography, Theodorus was born into a wealthy Christian family and was well educated from a young age.
GUM_bio_theodorus-6	Early in life he denied the excesses of his parents, and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne, near the modern town of Esna, Egypt.
GUM_bio_theodorus-7	A brother from Theodorus’ monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne.
GUM_bio_theodorus-8	Praying and weeping, Theodorus became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius.
GUM_bio_theodorus-9	Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background, Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk, and his persistence (and lack of obedience) paid off.
GUM_bio_theodorus-10	He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival, and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328.
GUM_bio_theodorus-11	Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius, Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery, and took on the title of the "brothers’ comforter".
GUM_bio_theodorus-12	Theodorus asserted his influence openly (which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years, despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy.
GUM_bio_theodorus-13	Finally, Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth, and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built.
GUM_bio_theodorus-14	Retiring to the monastery of Phbow, Pachomius gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese, though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus’ watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand.
GUM_bio_theodorus-15	Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery, Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years.
GUM_bio_theodorus-16	Despite his clear potential and popularity, Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority; though the old man's failing health soon changed things forever.
GUM_bio_theodorus-17	After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion, Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death.
GUM_bio_theodorus-18	Pachomius had not named a successor, and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died.
GUM_bio_theodorus-19	Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world's glory, he consented.
GUM_bio_theodorus-20	Unfortunately for the would-be leader, Pachomius recovered, and upon hearing of Theodorus’ decision, exiled the ambitious young man.
GUM_bio_theodorus-21	After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude, Pachomius forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more.
GUM_bio_theodorus-22	Normalcy returned, though never again would Pachomius fully trust his former protégé.
GUM_bio_theodorus-23	In 348 Pachomius died, naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus.
GUM_bio_theodorus-24	The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge, and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum.
GUM_bio_theodorus-25	Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia, problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader.
GUM_bio_theodorus-26	Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader, many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios.
GUM_bio_theodorus-27	The federation of monasteries was falling apart, and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels.
GUM_bio_theodorus-28	Soon after his arrival, Theodorus was the new de facto leader, though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios.
GUM_bio_theodorus-29	For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius’ old headquarters in Phbow, using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors, such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks.
GUM_bio_theodorus-30	Yet in spite of this somewhat unstable shifting, the Koinonia was ruled peacefully for nearly two decades, at which point Theodorus predicted he would soon die.
GUM_bio_theodorus-31	Within a few months his prediction came true, and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority. [1]
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-1	Everyone’s just watching the weird retarded girl except this one chubby guy who’s trying to get her to put down the lights but who’s afraid to touch her.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-2	“Not supposed to touch those,” he says.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-3	“Where’s your mom?
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-4	Is your mom here?”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-5	“Sorry!” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-6	The chubby guy frowns at me.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-7	“Cara,” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-8	“No hands.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-9	Cara looks at me, looks at the lights.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-10	I gently try to take them.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-11	“No!” she wails.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-12	“Pretty!”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-13	“I’m sorry,” I say, “I’m her brother.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-14	She’s developmentally delayed.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-15	Cara!
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-16	Cara, no.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-17	No hands.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-18	She wails, but lets me disentangle her hands.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-19	“I’m sorry,” I say again, the concerned big brother.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-20	“I was just looking around and thought she was right with me, you know?
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-21	Our mom’s down at Dillard’s.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-22	Chubby guy kind of hovers until I get the lights away from Cara and as soon as I put them on the shelf he grabs them and starts straightening them out and draping them back over the display.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-23	I herd Cara towards the front of the store, mouthing sorry at the front cashier.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-24	She’s kind of pretty.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-25	She smiles at me.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-26	Nice big brother with retarded sister.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-27	Back out in the mall, Cara is wailing, which could start an asthma attack, so to distract her I say, “You want a cookie?”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-28	Mom has Cara on a diet, so of course she wants a cookie.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-29	She perks up the way Shelby, our Shetland Sheepdog does, when you say ‘treat.’
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-30	I take her to the food court and buy her an M&M cookie and buy myself a Mountain Dew and then while she’s eating her cookie, I pull the deck of cards out of my pocket and unwrap it.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-31	We’ve got another fifteen minutes before we have to meet my mom.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-32	The idea is to play fish except every time you get a match you ’re supposed to do what it says.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-33	Tie partner’s hands with a silk scarf.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-34	Kiss anywhere you like and see how long your partner can keep from moving or making any noise.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-35	The one who lasts the longest gets to draw an extra card.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-36	Tame, but pretty cool.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-37	I can’t wait to show Toph and Len.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-38	Cara has chocolate smeared on her mouth, but she lets me wipe her face off.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-39	“You ready to go back to see Mom?” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-40	When we pass Spencer’s again, she stops.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-41	“Uhhh,” she says, pointing to the store.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-42	Mom always tries to get her to say what she wants, but I know what she wants and I don’t want to fight with her.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-43	“No,” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-44	“Let’s go see Mom.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-45	Cara’s face crumples up and she hunches her thick shoulders.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-46	“Uhhh,” she says, mad.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-47	“It’s okay,” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-48	“Come on.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-49	She swings at me.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-50	I grab her hand and pull her behind me.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-51	She tries to sit down, but I just keep on tugging and she follows me, gulping and wailing.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-52	“What did you do?” my mom says when she sees us.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-53	My mom had to buy stuff, like gym shorts for me and underwear for herself, so I told her that I’d take Cara with me while she bought her stuff.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-54	She’s holding a Dillard’s bag.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-55	“She wanted to go in Spencer’s,” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-56	“We went in but she kept grabbing stuff and I had to take her out and now she’s upset.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-57	“Robert,” my mom says, irritated.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-58	She crouches down.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-59	“Ah, Cara mia, don’t cry.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-60	We trail out of the store, Cara holding Mom’s hand and sniffling.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-61	By the time we get to the car, though, Cara’s wheezing.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-62	Mom digs out Cara’s inhaler and Cara dutifully takes a hit.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-63	I tried it once and it was pretty dreadful.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-64	It felt really weird, trying to get that stuff in my lungs, and it made me feel a little buzzy but it didn’t even feel good, so it’s pretty amazing that Cara will do it.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-65	Cara sits in her booster seat in the back of the car, wheezing all the way home, getting worse and worse, and by the time we pull in the driveway, she’s got that white look around her mouth.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-66	“Robert,” Mom says,
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-67	“I’m going to have to take her to the Emergency Room.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-68	“Okay,” I say and get out of the car.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-69	“You want to call your dad?” Mom asks.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-70	“I don’t know how long we’ll be.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-71	Mom checks her watch.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-72	It’s three something now.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-73	“We may not be home in time for dinner.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-74	I don’t want to call my dad who is probably with Joyce, his girlfriend, anyway.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-75	Joyce is always trying to be likable and it gets on my nerves after awhile — she tries way too hard.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-76	“I can just make a sandwich,” I say.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-77	“I want you to stay at home, then,” she says.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-78	“I’ve got my cell phone if you need to call.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-79	“Can Toph and Len come over?” I ask.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-80	She sighs.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-81	“Okay.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-82	But no roughhousing.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-83	Remember you have school tomorrow.”
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-84	She opens the garage door so I can get in.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-85	I stand there and watch her back down the driveway.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-86	She turns back, watching where she’s going, and she needs to get her hair done again because I can really see the gray roots.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-87	Cara is watching me through the watery glass, her mouth a little open.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-88	I wave good-bye.
GUM_fiction_frankenstein-89	I’m glad they ’re gone.
GUM_fiction_garden-1	The day it rained in the garden
GUM_fiction_garden-2	The first drops of rain fell onto the parched stones from a cloudless blue sky.
GUM_fiction_garden-3	They disappeared immediately, drunk down into the mineral silence.
GUM_fiction_garden-4	The garden paused, and everything held its breath and waited.
GUM_fiction_garden-5	More rain would come.
GUM_fiction_garden-6	Everyone knew, beyond belief or necessity that the time had come.
GUM_fiction_garden-7	And with it, the rain.
GUM_fiction_garden-8	Heavy oily drops bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground, gathering in stems and folds on the way.
GUM_fiction_garden-9	Yet still the sky was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight.
GUM_fiction_garden-10	Still the garden held its breath.
GUM_fiction_garden-11	It would not be long now.
GUM_fiction_garden-12	A spattering of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots, shivering through shoots and tendrils, humus and stone.
GUM_fiction_garden-13	Wispy vapour trails marbled the blue surface above.
GUM_fiction_garden-14	And then it rained for good.
GUM_fiction_garden-15	We sat on the porch watching, no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall as drops turned to torrents and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar.
GUM_fiction_garden-16	Pools erupted and overflowed along the edges of the lawn, cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds.
GUM_fiction_garden-17	Earthworms rose up from the water-laden earth where they could no longer breath and wriggled and struggled fro air on the surface, writhing and swimming for a safe haven.
GUM_fiction_garden-18	Water burst over the barrels and cans standing under the eaves and gutters, flooding the pathways, carrying away all that wasn’t fixed solid and licking at the stairs to the back porch before climbing each step and lapping against the planks we were sitting on, a wooden raft surrounded by angry water and martial beat drum, drum, drumming on the roof above.
GUM_fiction_garden-19	We slipped out feet over the sides and when we felt the fish, some as big as logs, some as small as leaves, nibble at our feet, we leant over to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface.
GUM_fiction_garden-20	Waves lapped at the porch, washing away the boxes, and bowls, and the dog’s basket.
GUM_fiction_garden-21	The rocking chair, the watering can, boxes of cuttings, and tied-up newspapers, all floated away as we slammed the kitchen door shut and retreated to the front room we gazed out at the river that the street had become.
GUM_fiction_garden-22	The sky was pewter smeared with charcoal now, and pressed down hard on the rooftops, slowly dissolving everything below.
GUM_fiction_garden-23	When the water rippled into the hallway, we splashed our way to the staircase and then up as it nipped at our heels.
GUM_fiction_garden-24	Outside the other houses were rocks surrounded by sea with mermaids swimming all around, flapping their scaly tails and hauling themselves up, to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves.
GUM_fiction_garden-25	And as they swam they sang, their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain, and we could hear them singing, He is coming, He is coming.
GUM_fiction_garden-26	And they combed their long hair in preparation.
GUM_fiction_garden-27	We waved and called, and they laughed and played, tantalising, their seaweed locks just out of reach.
GUM_fiction_garden-28	With a flick of the tail they were off, still singing, He is coming, He is coming, until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water.
GUM_fiction_garden-29	A great whiskered head arose, then a belly, wet and sleek, long enough to wrap itself twice around the world.
GUM_fiction_garden-30	“Is it him?” we asked each other, nudging elbows and climbing onto the chairs.
GUM_fiction_garden-31	We pulled off wet socks and shoes, letting them float away on the tide, before the great worm turned and the wake engulfed the creaking, cracking house.
GUM_fiction_garden-32	We clambered up onto the roof, sliding on the tiles and clinging to chimney stacks, sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour.
GUM_fiction_garden-33	The sky was black, and the stormy sea all the deepest, darkest blues and greens and greys and flecked with white where the sea-horses galloped.
GUM_fiction_garden-34	The waters broke making way for the gnarled head of a whale, spouting water high against the clouds before opening its whiskered maw and in a looming, booming voice called: He is coming, He is coming.
GUM_fiction_garden-35	The chimneys washed away, so we scrambled onto the blue-black back encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky and held on tight as he rode the waves, dipping and blowing, dipping and blowing.
GUM_fiction_garden-36	The wind and the rain tugged at our hair.
GUM_fiction_garden-37	And still it rained.
GUM_fiction_garden-38	We heard a fearsome creaking and cracking and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away, deeping down in the troughs and riding the crests with torn sails set against the wind.
GUM_fiction_garden-39	It was a galleon with masts like a dead man’s fingers, tarred timbers groaning and a mermaid sat on the bow as he ship dipped and passed.
GUM_fiction_garden-40	He is coming, He is coming, she sang out.
GUM_fiction_garden-41	And just as the wash hit us, prising us from the whale’s speckled back and down into the sea, someone threw down a knotted rope and we hung on for dear life.
GUM_fiction_garden-42	The singing sailors hauled us aboard chanting, He’s a coming - ha! He’s a coming - ha!
GUM_fiction_garden-43	And we fell onto the deck like fish bursting from a net.
GUM_fiction_garden-44	The Captain stood above us dressed in jewels and finery from a thousand pillagings.
GUM_fiction_giants-1	The Valley of Giants
GUM_fiction_giants-2	I had buried my parents in their gray marble mausoleum at the heart of the city.
GUM_fiction_giants-3	I had buried my husband in a lead box sunk into the mud of the bottom of the river, where all the riverboatmen lie.
GUM_fiction_giants-4	And after the war, I had buried my children, all four, in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland: all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills.
GUM_fiction_giants-5	I had one granddaughter who survived the war.
GUM_fiction_giants-6	I saw her sometimes: in a bright pink dress, a sparkling drink in her hand, on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders, at the edge of a marble patio.
GUM_fiction_giants-7	She never looked back at me — poverty and failure and political disrepute being all, these days, contagious and synonymous.
GUM_fiction_giants-8	The young were mostly dead, and the old men had been taken away, they told us, to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully.
GUM_fiction_giants-9	So it was a city of grandmothers.
GUM_fiction_giants-10	And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront — sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah-jongg — that I first heard of the valley of giants.
GUM_fiction_giants-11	We all laughed at the idea, except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face, who was incensed.
GUM_fiction_giants-12	“We live in the modern era!” she cried.
GUM_fiction_giants-13	“You should be ashamed of yourself!"
GUM_fiction_giants-14	The traveler stood up from the table.
GUM_fiction_giants-15	She was bony and rough-skinned and bent like an old crow, with a blue silk scarf and hanks of hair as black as soot.
GUM_fiction_giants-16	Her eyes were veined with red.
GUM_fiction_giants-17	“Nonetheless,” the traveler said, and she walked out.
GUM_fiction_giants-18	They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler.
GUM_fiction_giants-19	To find anyone still proud, anyone who believed in giants or shame, was hilarious.
GUM_fiction_giants-20	The air of the bar was acrid with triumph.
GUM_fiction_giants-21	Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were, after everything had been taken from us — that was a delight.
GUM_fiction_giants-22	But I followed the traveler, into the wet streets.
GUM_fiction_giants-23	The smell of fish oozed from the docks.
GUM_fiction_giants-24	Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters.
GUM_fiction_giants-25	I caught her at her door.
GUM_fiction_giants-26	She invited me in for tea and massage.
GUM_fiction_giants-27	Her limbs were weathered and ringed, like the branches of trees in the dry country.
GUM_fiction_giants-28	She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room, a little fermented.
GUM_fiction_giants-29	A heady smell.
GUM_fiction_giants-30	In the morning, brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor, and the traveler and her pack were gone.
GUM_fiction_giants-31	I hurried home.
GUM_fiction_giants-32	My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact, though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble.
GUM_fiction_giants-33	My house was empty and cold.
GUM_fiction_giants-34	I packed six loaves of flatbread, some olives, a hard cheese, one nice dress, walking clothes, my pills and glasses, a jug of wine, a can-teen of water, and a kitchen knife.
GUM_fiction_giants-35	I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while, looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting.
GUM_fiction_giants-36	That granddaughter: her parents both worked in the vineyards, and when she was a child, she would play in my courtyard in the after-noons.
GUM_fiction_giants-37	When she scraped her knees bloody on the stones, she refused to cry.
GUM_fiction_giants-38	She would cry from frustration when the older children could do something that she couldn't — like tie knots, or catch a chicken.
GUM_fiction_oversite-1	Oversite
GUM_fiction_oversite-2	“It doesn’t hurt, Gram,” Renata says.
GUM_fiction_oversite-3	My sixteen-year-old daughter pulls up her T-shirt sleeve to show her bare arm, the skin summer brown and the muscle swelling slightly into smooth biceps, flawless.
GUM_fiction_oversite-4	“I had it done when I was little and see, you can’t even tell.”
GUM_fiction_oversite-5	My mother is sitting in the little examining room at the assisted living.
GUM_fiction_oversite-6	Everything is white and hospital-like but there’s no examining couch.
GUM_fiction_oversite-7	There’s just a desk, a little white table with two chairs and a scale.
GUM_fiction_oversite-8	The doctor, a woman I don’t know, is sitting in the other chair.
GUM_fiction_oversite-9	My mother is bewildered, her face turned up towards me.
GUM_fiction_oversite-10	She’s got Alzheimer’s.
GUM_fiction_oversite-11	“It’s okay, Mom,” I say.
GUM_fiction_oversite-12	She wants to understand, I can see that.
GUM_fiction_oversite-13	So I explain again.
GUM_fiction_oversite-14	“It’s an implant that will let them know where you are, and how you are.
GUM_fiction_oversite-15	It won’t hurt.”
GUM_fiction_oversite-16	Her eyes water constantly, now.
GUM_fiction_oversite-17	In the time it takes me to explain she grasps and loses the words, grasps and loses phrases as they go past.
GUM_fiction_oversite-18	She looks at me and then at Renata, who is smiling, and finally submits uncomprehendingly.
GUM_fiction_oversite-19	We have worn her down.
GUM_fiction_oversite-20	The doctor bares my mother’s arm, where the crepey flesh hangs loosely on the bones.
GUM_fiction_oversite-21	The doctor swabs her upper arm with antiseptic and says, “I’m going to give you something to numb it, okay?”
GUM_fiction_oversite-22	To me the doctor says in her normal voice, “It’s just a little lidocaine.”
GUM_fiction_oversite-23	I don’t like the doctor, but I don’t know why.
GUM_fiction_oversite-24	She is no-nonsense.
GUM_fiction_oversite-25	She has professional hair, lightly streaked.
GUM_fiction_oversite-26	This is no reason to dislike her.
GUM_fiction_oversite-27	My mother winces at the injection and is surprised again.
GUM_fiction_oversite-28	She looks up at me, at Renata.
GUM_fiction_oversite-29	We are smiling, both of us.
GUM_fiction_oversite-30	“Okay,” my mother says.
GUM_fiction_oversite-31	What is okay?
GUM_fiction_oversite-32	I have no idea.
GUM_fiction_oversite-33	We wait for a few minutes.
GUM_fiction_oversite-34	My mother says, “Is it time to go?”
GUM_fiction_oversite-35	“Not yet,” I say.
GUM_fiction_oversite-36	“They ’re going to give you an injection.”
GUM_fiction_oversite-37	“What?” my mother says.
GUM_fiction_oversite-38	“They ’re going to implant a chip.
GUM_fiction_oversite-39	It will help them take care of you.”
GUM_fiction_oversite-40	I try to say it every time as if it was the first time I said it.
GUM_fiction_oversite-41	I don’t want to embarrass her.
GUM_fiction_oversite-42	Her head swings around, from Renata to me to the doctor and then back to Renata.
GUM_fiction_oversite-43	“It’s okay, Gram,” Renata says.
GUM_fiction_oversite-44	“Renata,” my mother says.
GUM_fiction_oversite-45	The doctor has an injection gun and while my mother is focused on my daughter, she puts it firmly against my mother’s arm and puts the chip in.
GUM_fiction_oversite-46	“Oh!” says my mother.
GUM_fiction_oversite-47	It’s another low-grade moment of horror, but I think about that particular time with my mother because Renata was there and we were united, she and I.
GUM_fiction_oversite-48	So that’s a good memory.
GUM_fiction_oversite-49	I come back to it a lot.
GUM_fiction_oversite-50	In the background, shining, is Renata, who is young and healthy and good, raising her arm to show her grandmother that the chip is nothing, nothing at all.
GUM_fiction_oversite-51	The last two nights I have dreamed of dogs in trouble.
GUM_fiction_oversite-52	I don’t dream about Renata, although when the dreams wake me up, it’s thinking about Renata that keeps me awake.
GUM_fiction_oversite-53	The first night I dreamed of seeing a stray dog and not stopping to pick it up although it was wandering in an empty parking lot near a busy road.
GUM_fiction_oversite-54	That was the first night Renata didn’t come home and it doesn’t take Freud to figure out what that meant.
GUM_fiction_oversite-55	Seventeen-year-olds sleep on friends’ couches, I know.
GUM_fiction_oversite-56	Or Renata might be sleeping in her car.
GUM_fiction_oversite-57	The second night I dreamed that I was on a desert island and Sonia, our golden retriever, was with me.
GUM_fiction_oversite-58	There was some horrible fate impending for Sonia and I had to kill her before something worse happened.
GUM_fiction_oversite-59	I laid her down on some sticks.
GUM_fiction_oversite-60	She trusts me, she’s more my dog than anyone’s, and she didn’t like it but for me she lay there.
GUM_fiction_oversite-61	In my dream I told her, “Stay, Sonia. Stay.”
GUM_fiction_oversite-62	She stayed because I held her there by looking at her, the way you can sometimes will a dog into submission.
GUM_fiction_oversite-63	She stayed while I lit the fire.
GUM_fiction_oversite-64	And then the horror of it all hit me and I said, “Sonia, up!”
GUM_fiction_oversite-65	And I woke up.
GUM_fiction_oversite-66	That was last night, the second night Renata didn’t come home.
GUM_fiction_pag-1	Prologue
GUM_fiction_pag-2	"Try to touch the past.
GUM_fiction_pag-3	Try to deal with the past.
GUM_fiction_pag-4	It's not real.
GUM_fiction_pag-5	It's just a dream."
GUM_fiction_pag-6	— Ted Bundy
GUM_fiction_pag-7	It didn't start out here.
GUM_fiction_pag-8	Not with the scramblers or Rorschach, not with Big Ben or Theseus or the vampires.
GUM_fiction_pag-9	Most people would say it started with the Fireflies, but they'd be wrong.
GUM_fiction_pag-10	It ended with all those things.
GUM_fiction_pag-11	For me, it began with Robert Paglino.
GUM_fiction_pag-12	At the age of eight, he was my best and only friend.
GUM_fiction_pag-13	We were fellow outcasts, bound by complementary misfortune.
GUM_fiction_pag-14	Mine was developmental.
GUM_fiction_pag-15	His was genetic: an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed to nearsightedness, acne, and (as it later turned out) a susceptibility to narcotics.
GUM_fiction_pag-16	His parents had never had him optimized.
GUM_fiction_pag-17	Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also held that one shouldn't try to improve upon His handiwork.
GUM_fiction_pag-18	So although both of us could have been repaired, only one of us had been.
GUM_fiction_pag-19	I arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for some half-dozen kids, those lucky few in front punching him in the head, the others making do with taunts of mongrel and polly while waiting their turn.
GUM_fiction_pag-20	I watched him raise his arms, almost hesitantly, to ward off the worst of the blows.
GUM_fiction_pag-21	I could see into his head better than I could see into my own; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back, that they'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more.
GUM_fiction_pag-22	Even then, at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone, I was becoming a superlative observer.
GUM_fiction_pag-23	But I didn't know what to do.
GUM_fiction_pag-24	I hadn't seen much of Pag lately.
GUM_fiction_pag-25	I was pretty sure he'd been avoiding me.
GUM_fiction_pag-26	Still, when your best friend's in trouble you help out, right?
GUM_fiction_pag-27	Even if the odds are impossible — and how many eight-year-olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox buddy? — at least you call for backup.
GUM_fiction_pag-28	Flag a sentry.
GUM_fiction_pag-29	Something.
GUM_fiction_pag-30	I just stood there.
GUM_fiction_pag-31	I didn't even especially want to help him.
GUM_fiction_pag-32	That didn't make sense.
GUM_fiction_pag-33	Even if he hadn't been my best friend, I should at least have empathized.
GUM_fiction_pag-34	I'd suffered less than Pag in the way of overt violence; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a distance, scared them even as they incapacitated me.
GUM_fiction_pag-35	Still.
GUM_fiction_pag-36	I was no stranger to the taunts and insults, or the foot that appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B.
GUM_fiction_pag-37	I knew how that felt.
GUM_fiction_pag-38	Or I had, once.
GUM_fiction_pag-39	But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring.
GUM_fiction_pag-40	I was still working up the algorithms to get it back, still learning by observation.
GUM_fiction_pag-41	Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their midst.
GUM_fiction_pag-42	Every child knows that much instinctively.
GUM_fiction_pag-43	Maybe I should just let that process unfold, maybe I shouldn't try to mess with nature.
GUM_fiction_pag-44	Then again, Pag's parents hadn't messed with nature, and look what it got them: a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs.
GUM_fiction_pag-45	In the end, propaganda worked where empathy failed.
GUM_fiction_pag-46	Back then I didn't so much think as observe, didn't deduce so much as remember — and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog.
GUM_fiction_pag-47	So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game.
GUM_fiction_pag-48	A third, turning to face the new threat, took a blow to the face that audibly crunched the bones of his cheek.
GUM_fiction_pag-49	I remember wondering why I didn't take any satisfaction from that sound, why it meant nothing beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about.
GUM_fiction_pag-50	The rest of them ran at the sight of blood.
GUM_fiction_pag-51	One of the braver promised me I was dead, shouted "Fucking zombie!" over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner.
GUM_fiction_pag-52	Three decades it took, to see the irony in that remark.
GUM_fiction_pag-53	Two of the enemy twitched at my feet.
GUM_fiction_pag-54	I kicked one in the head until it stopped moving, turned to the other.
GUM_fiction_pag-55	Something grabbed my arm and I swung without thinking, without looking until Pag yelped and ducked out of reach.
GUM_fiction_pag-56	"Oh," I said.
GUM_fiction_pag-57	"Sorry."
GUM_fiction_pag-58	One thing lay motionless.
GUM_fiction_pag-59	The other moaned and held its head and curled up in a ball.
GUM_fiction_pag-60	"Oh shit," Pag panted.
GUM_fiction_pag-61	Blood coursed unheeded from his nose and splattered down his shirt.
GUM_fiction_pag-62	His cheek was turning blue and yellow.
GUM_fiction_pag-63	"Oh shit oh shit oh shit ... "
GUM_fiction_pag-64	I thought of something to say.
GUM_fiction_pag-65	"You all right?"
GUM_fiction_pag-66	"Oh shit, you — I mean, you never ..."
GUM_fiction_pag-67	He wiped his mouth.
GUM_fiction_pag-68	Blood smeared the back of his hand.
GUM_fiction_pag-69	"Oh man are we in trouble."
GUM_fiction_pag-70	"They started it."
GUM_fiction_pag-71	"Yeah, but you — I mean, look at them!"
GUM_fiction_pag-72	The moaning thing was crawling away on all fours.
GUM_fiction_pag-73	I wondered how long it would be before it found reinforcements.
GUM_fiction_pag-74	I wondered if I should kill it before then.
GUM_fiction_pag-75	"You'd anever done that before," Pag said.
GUM_fiction_pag-76	Before the operation, he meant.
GUM_fiction_pag-77	I actually did feel something then — faint, distant, but unmistakable.
GUM_fiction_pag-78	I felt angry.
GUM_fiction_pag-79	"They started —"
GUM_fiction_pag-80	Pag backed away, eyes wide.
GUM_fiction_pag-81	"What are you doing?
GUM_fiction_pag-82	Put that down!"
GUM_fiction_pag-83	I'd raised my fists.
GUM_fiction_pag-84	I didn't remember doing that.
GUM_fiction_pag-85	I unclenched them.
GUM_fiction_pag-86	It took a while.
GUM_fiction_pag-87	I had to look at my hands very hard for a long, long time.
GUM_fiction_pag-88	The rock dropped to the ground, blood-slick and glistening.
GUM_fiction_pag-89	"I was trying to help."
GUM_fiction_pag-90	I didn't understand why he couldn't see that.
GUM_fiction_pag-91	"You 're, you 're not the same," Pag said from a safe distance.
GUM_fiction_pag-92	"You 're not even Siri any more."
GUM_fiction_pag-93	"I am too.
GUM_fiction_pag-94	Don't be a fuckwad."
GUM_fiction_pag-95	"They cut out your brain!"
GUM_fiction_pag-96	"Only half.
GUM_fiction_pag-97	For the ep —"
GUM_fiction_pag-98	"I know for the epilepsy!
GUM_fiction_pag-99	You think I don't know?
GUM_fiction_pag-100	But you were in that half — or, like, part of you was ..."
GUM_fiction_pag-101	He struggled with the words, with the concept behind them.
GUM_fiction_pag-102	"And now you 're different.
GUM_fiction_pag-103	It's like, your mom and dad murdered you —"
GUM_fiction_pag-104	"My mom and dad," I said, suddenly quiet, "saved my life.
GUM_fiction_pag-105	I would have died."
GUM_fiction_pag-106	"I think you did die," said my best and only friend.
GUM_fiction_pag-107	"I think Siri died, they scooped him out and threw him away and you 're some whole other kid that just, just grew back out of what was left.
GUM_fiction_pag-108	You 're not the same.
GUM_fiction_pag-109	Ever since.
GUM_fiction_pag-110	You 're not the same."
GUM_fiction_rose-1	Stranger Things Happen -
GUM_fiction_rose-2	Water Off a Black Dog’s Back
GUM_fiction_rose-3	Rachel Rook took Carroll home to meet her parents two months after she first slept with him.
GUM_fiction_rose-4	For a generous girl, a girl who took off her clothes with abandon, she was remarkably close-mouthed about some things.
GUM_fiction_rose-5	In two months Carroll had learned that her parents lived on a farm several miles outside of town; that they sold strawberries in summer, and Christmas trees in the winter.
GUM_fiction_rose-6	He knew that they never left the farm; instead, the world came to them in the shape of weekend picnickers and driveby tourists.
GUM_fiction_rose-7	Do you think your parents will like me?" he said.
GUM_fiction_rose-8	He had spent the afternoon preparing for this visit as carefully as if he were preparing for an exam.
GUM_fiction_rose-9	He had gotten his hair cut, trimmed his nails, washed his neck and behind his ears.
GUM_fiction_rose-10	The outfit he had chosen, khaki pants and a blue button-down shirt -- no tie -- lay neatly folded on the bed.
GUM_fiction_rose-11	He stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks, gazing at her as if she were a mirror.
GUM_fiction_rose-12	"No," she said.
GUM_fiction_rose-13	It was the first time she had been to his apartment, and she stood square in the center of his bedroom, her arms folded against her body as if she was afraid to sit down, to touch something.
GUM_fiction_rose-14	"Why?"
GUM_fiction_rose-15	"My father will like you," she said.
GUM_fiction_rose-16	"But he likes everyone.
GUM_fiction_rose-17	My mother's more particular --
GUM_fiction_rose-18	she thinks that you lack a serious nature."
GUM_fiction_rose-19	Carroll put on his pants, admiring the crease.
GUM_fiction_rose-20	"So you've talked to her about me."
GUM_fiction_rose-21	"Yes."
GUM_fiction_rose-22	"But you haven't talked about her to me."
GUM_fiction_rose-23	"No."
GUM_fiction_rose-24	"Are you ashamed of her?"
GUM_fiction_rose-25	Rachel snorted.
GUM_fiction_rose-26	Then she sighed in a way that seemed to suggest she was regretting her decision to take him home.
GUM_fiction_rose-27	"You 're ashamed of me," he guessed, and Rachel kissed him and smiled and didn't say anything.
GUM_fiction_rose-28	Rachel still lived on her parents' farm, which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long.
GUM_fiction_rose-29	It suggested a talent for daily organization that filled Carroll's heart with admiration and lust.
GUM_fiction_rose-30	She was nineteen, two years younger than Carroll; she was a student at Jellicoh College and every weekday she rose at seven and biked four miles into town, and then back again on her bike, four miles uphill to the farm.
GUM_fiction_rose-31	Carroll met Rachel in the Jellicoh College library, where he had a part-time job.
GUM_fiction_rose-32	He sat at the checkout desk, stamping books and reading Tristram Shandy for a graduate class; he was almost asleep when someone said, "Excuse me."
GUM_fiction_rose-33	He looked up.
GUM_fiction_rose-34	The girl who stood before the tall desk was red-headed.
GUM_fiction_rose-35	Sunlight streaming in through a high window opposite her lit up the fine hairs on her arm, the embroidered flowers on the collar of her white shirt.
GUM_fiction_rose-36	The sunlight turned her hair to fire and Carroll found it difficult to look directly at her.
GUM_fiction_rose-37	"Can I help you?" he said.
GUM_fiction_rose-38	She placed a shredded rectangle on the desk, and Carroll picked it up between his thumb and forefinger.
GUM_fiction_rose-39	Pages hung in tatters from the sodden blue spine.
GUM_fiction_rose-40	Title, binding, and covers had been gnawed away.
GUM_fiction_rose-41	"I need to pay for a damaged book," she said.
GUM_fiction_rose-42	"What happened? Did your dog eat it?" he said, making a joke.
GUM_fiction_rose-43	"Yes," she said, and smiled.
GUM_fiction_rose-44	"What's your name?" Carroll said.
GUM_fiction_rose-45	Already, he thought he might be in love.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-1	Doesn’t it make you just want to sneeze?
GUM_fiction_sneeze-2	Pete was leaning against the wall, watching the street go by.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-3	I pulled the bike to a halt, the front wheel pointing in his direction.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-4	“I think I’ve got a fairy stuck up my nose.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-5	“S’ not true!” came a voice from inside the nose in question.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-6	“Hey! Not bad that!” Pete said.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-7	“I didn’t see your lips move at all.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-8	“It’s not a joke.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-9	The itching was getting worse.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-10	I pulled out a paper tissue.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-11	“Stop that now!” came the voice again.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-12	“You know I don’t like it.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-13	“S’ not my fault.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-14	You make me want to sneeze!”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-15	And I did.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-16	I inspected the crumpled paper.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-17	Lots of yellow goo, but no fairy.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-18	Pete looked at me with mild disgust as I eyed the handkerchief more closely.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-19	“You know that’s pretty gross …” he said.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-20	“Got any other brilliant remarks?” I said.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-21	I held a finger up to my lips, and waved a hand to silence Pete’s reply.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-22	“Are you still there?” I called.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-23	“No thanks to you!” came the little voice.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-24	Pete looked at me sort of sideways.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-25	“Look, the first time was OK, but —”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-26	“It’s not a joke.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-27	I’ve really got something stuck up there.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-28	I was riding on me bike and I thought I’d swallowed an insect or something.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-29	And then it started insulting me.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-30	“You ’re having me on, right?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-31	“Pete!
GUM_fiction_sneeze-32	Look at me.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-33	If it’s a trick, how do I do it then?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-34	Pete thought for a moment.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-35	“If it’s real … Aren’t they supposed to have a pot of gold or something?
GUM_fiction_sneeze-36	And they have to tell you where it is if you catch them?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-37	“That’s leprechauns, idiot!” said the voice from my noise.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-38	“So what’s the difference?
GUM_fiction_sneeze-39	Just give us the gold and we’ll let you go …”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-40	“We —?” I started.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-41	He winked at me.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-42	“Oh, I’m happy to stick around,” came the voice.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-43	“It’s noggins here who wants to get rid of me …”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-44	Suddenly I felt a violent pain in my nose, my eyes watered.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-45	“Owwww!” I howled.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-46	“See what I mean?” the voice shouted over my moans.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-47	“Perhaps you can use it in exams …” Pete said, scratching his head.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-48	“You know, it could tell us all the answers.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-49	“Idiot!
GUM_fiction_sneeze-50	If it yacks on like that in an exam, I’ll get thrown out.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-51	And probably locked up too.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-52	“Can’t it whisper?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-53	“Perhaps I don’t know the answers anyway?” said the voice.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-54	“Have you thought of that?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-55	“Anyway, I don’t want it in exams.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-56	I just want it to go.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-57	Out of my nose.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-58	“Can’t you just poke it out?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-59	“With what?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-60	“S’pose you’ve already tried your finger …”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-61	“Yes he has,” the voice said.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-62	“And it wasn’t pleasant I can tell you.”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-63	“You see what it’s like.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-64	He’s already making sarcastic remarks like that …”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-65	“What if we put something in your nose to catch it, then?
GUM_fiction_sneeze-66	I don’t know … A spider?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-67	“No!” we both said at once.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-68	“Snap!” Pete said.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-69	“You both said the same thing at the same time, you’ve got to make a —” He hit his forehead with his palm.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-70	“That’s it!
GUM_fiction_sneeze-71	Three wishes!
GUM_fiction_sneeze-72	When you catch a fairy, you get three wishes.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-73	Hey you in there!
GUM_fiction_sneeze-74	Is that right?”
GUM_fiction_sneeze-75	“You could see things like that …” said the voice with resignation.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-76	“I wish you’d get out of my nose, then!” I cried.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-77	In a flash the fairy was out of my nose and gone.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-78	And I’m still waiting for my two other wishes.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-79	THE END
GUM_fiction_sneeze-80	Something a little lighter this week, I hope you enjoy it.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-81	Once it got started, I realised that the idea must have been inspired by the title of Justine Larbalestier’s How to Ditch Your Fairy, although it has nothing at all to do with that story at all.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-82	All in all, my story feels very light.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-83	But I think I needed something a little less dark, and there are some quite sombre tales coming up in the coming weeks.
GUM_fiction_sneeze-84	See you then.
GUM_fiction_veronique-1	The Cost to Be Wise
GUM_fiction_veronique-2	Veronique stayed with me that night, lying next to me in my blankets and furs.
GUM_fiction_veronique-3	She didn't sleep, I don't think.
GUM_fiction_veronique-4	I was listening to her breath.
GUM_fiction_veronique-5	I felt as if I should help her sleep.
GUM_fiction_veronique-6	I lay there and tried to think if I should put my arm around her, but I didn't know.
GUM_fiction_veronique-7	Maybe she didn't want to be touched.
GUM_fiction_veronique-8	And she had been a stupid girl, anyway.
GUM_fiction_veronique-9	She lay tense in the dark.
GUM_fiction_veronique-10	"Are you going to be a teacher?" I asked.
GUM_fiction_veronique-11	She laughed.
GUM_fiction_veronique-12	"If I get out of here."
GUM_fiction_veronique-13	I waited for her to say more, but she didn't.
GUM_fiction_veronique-14	"Get out of here" meant to make someone leave.
GUM_fiction_veronique-15	Maybe she meant if she made herself.
GUM_fiction_veronique-16	"You come here from Earth?" I asked.
GUM_fiction_veronique-17	To get her to talk, although I was tired of lingua and I didn't really want to think about anything.
GUM_fiction_veronique-18	"My family came here from Earth," she said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-19	"Why?"
GUM_fiction_veronique-20	"My father, he's an anthropologist," she said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-21	"Do you know anthropologist?"
GUM_fiction_veronique-22	"No," I said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-23	"He is a person who studies the way people live.
GUM_fiction_veronique-24	And he is a teacher."
GUM_fiction_veronique-25	All the offworlders I had ever met were teachers.
GUM_fiction_veronique-26	I wondered who did all the work on Earth.
GUM_fiction_veronique-27	"Because Earth had lost touch with your world, the people here are very interesting to my father," she said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-28	Her voice was listless in the dark and she was even harder to understand when I couldn't see her properly.
GUM_fiction_veronique-29	I didn't understand so I didn't say anything.
GUM_fiction_veronique-30	I was sorry I'd started her talking.
GUM_fiction_veronique-31	"History, do you know the word ' history '?" she asked.
GUM_fiction_veronique-32	Of course I knew the word "history."
GUM_fiction_veronique-33	"I study history in school," I said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-34	Anneal and Kumar taught it.
GUM_fiction_veronique-35	"Do you know the history of this world?"
GUM_fiction_veronique-36	It took my tired head a long time to sort that out.
GUM_fiction_veronique-37	"Yes," I said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-38	"We are a colony.
GUM_fiction_veronique-39	People from Earth come here to live.
GUM_fiction_veronique-40	Then there is a big problem on Earth, and the people of Earth forget we are here.
GUM_fiction_veronique-41	We forget we are from Earth.
GUM_fiction_veronique-42	Then Earth finds us again."
GUM_fiction_veronique-43	"Some people have stories about coming from the Earth," Veronique said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-44	"My father is collecting those stories from different peoples.
GUM_fiction_veronique-45	I'm a graduate student."
GUM_fiction_veronique-46	The clans didn't have any stories about coming from Earth.
GUM_fiction_veronique-47	We said the first people came out of the sun.
GUM_fiction_veronique-48	This somehow seemed embarrassing.
GUM_fiction_veronique-49	I didn't understand what kind of student she was.
GUM_fiction_veronique-50	"Are you here for stories?" I asked.
GUM_fiction_veronique-51	"No," she said.
GUM_fiction_veronique-52	"Ian is old friends with your teacher, from back when they were both with the survey.
GUM_fiction_veronique-53	We just came to visit."
GUM_fiction_veronique-54	I didn't understand what she'd said except that they were visiting.
GUM_fiction_veronique-55	We were quiet after that.
GUM_fiction_veronique-56	I pretended to sleep.
GUM_fiction_veronique-57	Sometimes there was gunfire outside and we jumped, even Mam on the bed.
GUM_fiction_veronique-58	Everyone but Bet.
GUM_fiction_veronique-59	Once Bet was asleep it was impossible to wake her up.
GUM_fiction_veronique-60	I fell asleep thinking about how I wished that the Scathalos outrunners were gone.
GUM_fiction_veronique-61	I dreamed that I was at the offworlder's home, where it was summer but no one was taking care of the stabros, and they were all glad, and so I was a hero - and I was startled awake by gunfire.
GUM_fiction_veronique-62	Just more drinking and shooting.
GUM_fiction_veronique-63	I wished my da would come home.
GUM_fiction_veronique-64	It didn't seem fair that we should lie here and be afraid while the men were getting drunk and singing.
GUM_fiction_wedding-1	The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz
GUM_fiction_wedding-2	A ROMANCE IN EIGHT DAYS by JOHANN VALENTIN ANDREAE in a new version by JOHN CROWLEY illustrated by THEO FADEL
GUM_fiction_wedding-3	SMALL BEER PRESS EASTHAMPTON, MASS.
GUM_fiction_wedding-4	Introduction
GUM_fiction_wedding-5	I
GUM_fiction_wedding-6	The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way I’ve decided to present the title of this book.
GUM_fiction_wedding-7	Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz, which suggests (and most people who’ve heard of it suppose) that the wedding is Christian’s.
GUM_fiction_wedding-8	It’s not; Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding.
GUM_fiction_wedding-9	The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae, whose name didn’t appear on the book originally, thus ensuring the confusion.
GUM_fiction_wedding-10	I’ll call it herein(as everyone mostly does) simply The Chemical Wedding.
GUM_fiction_wedding-11	Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events it tells of, it’s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable without knowing that context, and experiencing the book unmediated.
GUM_fiction_wedding-12	You might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text that follows and only then return to this introduction.
GUM_fiction_wedding-13	Consider a similar case: a little book published in 1934 by the Surrealist artist Max Ernst called Une Semaine de Bonté.
GUM_fiction_wedding-14	It was made entirely of collaged illustrations cut out of old books
GUM_fiction_wedding-15	The First Day
GUM_fiction_wedding-16	It was just before Easter Sunday, 1 and I was sitting at my table.
GUM_fiction_wedding-17	I’d said my prayers, talking a long time as usual with my Maker and thinking about some of the great mysteries the Father of Lights had revealed to me.
GUM_fiction_wedding-18	Now I was ready to make and to bake – only in my heart, actually – a small, perfect unleavened wafer to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb.
GUM_fiction_wedding-19	All of a sudden a terrible wind blew up, so strong that I thought the hill my little house was built on would be blown apart – but I’d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before (the Devil had often tried to harm me), so I took heart and went on meditating.
GUM_fiction_wedding-20	Till I felt somebody touch me on the back.
GUM_fiction_wedding-21	This frightened me so that I didn’t dare turn.
GUM_fiction_wedding-22	I tried to stay as brave and calm as a human being could under the circumstances.
GUM_fiction_wedding-23	I felt my coat tugged at, and tugged again, and at last I looked around.
GUM_fiction_wedding-24	A woman stood there, so bright and beautiful, in a sky-colored robe – a heavens covered with
GUM_fiction_wedding-25	1 Christian’s story begins just before Easter, like Dante’s Divine Comedy.
GUM_fiction_wedding-26	It can be seen as an allegory of Christ’s death and resurrection, though this idea produces some puzzles.
GUM_fiction_wedding-27	The birds sang so beautifully, the young deer skipped so happily, that it gladdened my old heart, and I couldn't help singing too ...
GUM_fiction_wedding-28	THE FOURTH DAY
GUM_fiction_wedding-29	I was awake and lying in bed next morning, looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room, when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets, as if a procession were already underway.
GUM_fiction_wedding-30	My page jumped out of bed as if crazed, looking more dead than alive, and you can imagine how I felt when he cried, “They 're already being presented to the king!"
GUM_fiction_wedding-31	I could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones.
GUM_fiction_wedding-32	I got dressed, but my page was quicker than I was and ran out of the chamber to see what was what.
GUM_fiction_wedding-33	He soon came back and gave me the good news that I actually hadn’t overslept; all I’d done was miss breakfast: they hadn’t wanted to wake an old man who needed his rest.
GUM_fiction_wedding-34	But now I had to get ready to go with him to the lion fountain, where most of the others were gathered.
GUM_fiction_wedding-35	Such a relief!
GUM_fiction_wedding-36	My spirits recovered, and as soon as I had got into my habit, I followed him to the garden I have already told about.
GUM_fiction_wedding-37	I found that the lion, in place of his sword, now held a rather large plaque.
GUM_fiction_wedding-38	Examining this, I could tell that it had been taken from those ancient monuments I’d seen and put here for some special reason.
GUM_fiction_wedding-39	The inscription on it was fading away, so I should set it down here as it was then, and ask my readers to ponder it:
GUM_fiction_wedding-40	Prince Hermes: Now after humankind has suffered so much harm here I flow having by god’s counsel and with the help of art become a healing balm.
GUM_fiction_wedding-41	Drink from me if you can; wash, if you like; trouble my waters if you dare.
GUM_fiction_wedding-42	Drink, Brethren!
GUM_fiction_wedding-43	Drink and live!
GUM_interview_ants-1	Biologist Nick Bos tells Wikinews about 'self-medicating' ants
GUM_interview_ants-2	Tuesday, September 1, 2015
GUM_interview_ants-3	Formica fusca, from file.

GUM_interview_ants-5	Nick Bos, of the University of Helsinki, studies "the amazing adaptations social insects have evolved in order to fight the extreme parasite pressure they experience".
GUM_interview_ants-6	In a recently-accepted Evolution paper Bos and colleagues describe ants appearing to self-medicate.
GUM_interview_ants-7	"I have no doubt that as time goes on, there will be more and more cases documented"
GUM_interview_ants-8	The team used Formica fusca, an ant species that can form thousand-strong colonies.
GUM_interview_ants-9	This common black ant eats other insects, and also aphid honeydew.
GUM_interview_ants-10	It often nests in tree stumps or under rocks and foraging workers can sometimes be spotted climbing trees.
GUM_interview_ants-11	Some ants were infected with Beauveria bassiana, a fungus.
GUM_interview_ants-12	Infected ants chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide, whereas healthy ants avoided it.
GUM_interview_ants-13	Hydrogen peroxide reduced infected ant fatalities by 15%, and the ants varied their intake depending upon how high the peroxide concentration was.
GUM_interview_ants-14	In the wild, Formica fusca can encounter similar chemicals in aphids and dead ants.
GUM_interview_ants-15	The Independent reported self-medicating ants a first among insects.
GUM_interview_ants-16	Bos obtained his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen.
GUM_interview_ants-17	He began postdoctoral research at Helsinki in 2012.
GUM_interview_ants-18	He also runs the AntyScience blog.
GUM_interview_ants-19	The blog aims to help address "a gap between scientists and 'the general public'."
GUM_interview_ants-20	The name is a pun referencing ants, its primary topic, science, and "non-scientific" jargon-free communication.
GUM_interview_ants-21	He now discusses his work with Wikinews.

GUM_interview_ants-24	What first attracted you to researching ants?
GUM_interview_ants-25	Me and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies, from beetles, to butterflies and mantids, to ants.
GUM_interview_ants-26	We had the ants in an observation nest, and I could just look at them for hours, watching them go about.
GUM_interview_ants-27	This was in my third year of Biology study I think.
GUM_interview_ants-28	After a while I needed to start thinking about an internship for my M.Sc. studies, and decided to write a couple of professors.
GUM_interview_ants-29	I ended up going to the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen where I did a project on learning in Ants under supervision of Prof. Patrizia d'Ettorre.
GUM_interview_ants-30	I liked it so much there I ended up doing a PhD and I've been working on social insects ever since.
GUM_interview_ants-31	What methods and equipment were used for this investigation?
GUM_interview_ants-32	This is a fun one.
GUM_interview_ants-33	I try to work on a very low budget, and like to build most of the experimental setups myself (we actually have equipment in the lab nicknamed the 'Nickinator', 'i-Nick' and the 'Nicktendo64').
GUM_interview_ants-34	There's not that much money in fundamental science at the moment, so I try to cut the costs wherever possible.
GUM_interview_ants-35	We collected wild colonies of Formica fusca by searching through old tree-trunks in old logging sites in southern Finland.
GUM_interview_ants-36	We then housed the ants in nests I made using Y-tong [aerated concrete].
GUM_interview_ants-37	It's very soft stone that you can easily carve.
GUM_interview_ants-38	We carved out little squares for the ants to live in (covered with old CD covers to prevent them escaping!).
GUM_interview_ants-39	We then drilled a tunnel to a pot (the foraging arena), where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine and the food without.
GUM_interview_ants-40	We infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana.
GUM_interview_ants-41	Afterwards, each ant was dipped in the solution for a couple of seconds, dried on a cloth and put in the nest.
GUM_interview_ants-42	After exposing the ants to the fungus, we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day, and counted how many ants were present on each food-source.
GUM_interview_ants-43	Example of aerated concrete, which provided a home for the subjects.
GUM_interview_ants-44	Image: Marco Bernardini.
GUM_interview_ants-45	This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected.
GUM_interview_ants-46	The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [Reactive Oxygen Species, the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way (as you have to 'force feed' the ROS, as healthy ants, when given the choice, ignore that food-source.)
GUM_interview_ants-47	For this we basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while.
GUM_interview_ants-48	And afterwards either infected them or not. Then for about two weeks we count every day how many ants died.
GUM_interview_ants-49	This gives us the data to do a so-called survival analysis.
GUM_interview_ants-50	We measured the ROS-concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a spectrophotometer.
GUM_interview_ants-51	By adding certain chemicals, the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length.
GUM_interview_ants-52	The detrimental effect of ROS on spores was easy to measure.
GUM_interview_ants-53	We mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores, plated them out on petridishes with an agar-solution where fungus can grow on.
GUM_interview_ants-54	A day after, we counted how many spores were still alive.
GUM_interview_ants-55	How reliable do you consider your results to be?
GUM_interview_ants-56	The results we got are very reliable.
GUM_interview_ants-57	We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants, and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind.
GUM_interview_ants-58	This means the experimenter doesn't know which ants belong to which treatment, so it's impossible to influence the results with 'observer bias'.
GUM_interview_ants-59	However, of course this is proof in just one species.
GUM_interview_ants-60	It is hard to extrapolate to other ants, as different species lead very different lives.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-1	Wikinews interviews President of the International Brotherhood of Magicians
GUM_interview_brotherhood-2	Wednesday, October 9, 2013
GUM_interview_brotherhood-3	October is National Magic Month in the United States.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-4	Wikinews spoke with William Evans, president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, about the current state of magic and what its future looks like in the world of entertainment.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-5	For how long have you been involved in performing / studying magic?
GUM_interview_brotherhood-6	Over 50 years.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-7	I am 61 now so I really started when I was about 10 years old even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-8	I remember going into Hollywood Magic and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it and I didn't even know what it did.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-9	The magician behind the counter was wise enough not to sell it to me, but instead sold me two books which I still own today - "Scarne on Card Tricks" and "Scarne on Magic Tricks".
GUM_interview_brotherhood-10	That started me out on books and I have amassed quite a few since then.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-11	My major influences on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-12	October is National Magic Month in the US.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-13	Do you think magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment today?
GUM_interview_brotherhood-14	Absolutely.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-15	There are more magicians working today than ever before.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-16	There will always be an audience for good magicians doing good magic.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-17	Has the internet helped or hurt magic?
GUM_interview_brotherhood-18	Both.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-19	I think it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby, but I think it has hurt the ability of young magicians to think because so many rely on the internet for everything and they aren't reading the books.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-20	We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-21	Moreover, seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses, originality and imagination that reading and thinking about magic can produce.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-22	Anyone can become a monkey; it takes serious study to become a magician.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-23	Do you travel much in your current role?
GUM_interview_brotherhood-24	Yes, I am traveling quite a bit.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-25	After I was inducted as International President in Phoenix in July, I have been to the Jeff McBride Experience in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, Magic Live in Las Vegas, The Midwest Magic Jubilee in St. Louis, the TAOM in Dallas, the British Ring Convention in Buxton, England and the Magic Circle in London.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-26	I am going to Las Vegas and Los Angeles next month, Italy in November, back to Las Vegas in December, Mexico in January, Magi-Fest in February, the Winter Carnival of Magic in Tennessee in March, Eureka Springs Cavalcade of Magic in March, and the FFFF in April.
GUM_interview_brotherhood-27	That's as of now.

GUM_interview_chomsky-1	Interview with US political activist and philosopher Noam Chomsky
GUM_interview_chomsky-2	Saturday, April 4, 2009
GUM_interview_chomsky-3	Political activist and philosopher Noam Chomsky
GUM_interview_chomsky-4	Noam Chomsky is a professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Linguistics and Philosophy.
GUM_interview_chomsky-5	At the age of 40 he was credited with revolutionizing the field of modern linguistics.
GUM_interview_chomsky-6	He was one of the first opponents of the Vietnam War, and is a self-described Libertarian Socialist.
GUM_interview_chomsky-7	At age 80 he continues to write books; his latest book, Hegemony or Survival, was a bestseller in non-fiction.
GUM_interview_chomsky-8	According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index Professor Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar of all time.
GUM_interview_chomsky-9	On March 13, Professor Chomsky sat down with Michael Dranove for an interview in his MIT office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
GUM_interview_chomsky-10	On NATO
GUM_interview_chomsky-11	I just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent NATO actions and the protests coming up at the 60th NATO conference, I know you ’re speaking at the counter-conference.
GUM_interview_chomsky-12	Could be I give so many talks I can’t remember.
GUM_interview_chomsky-13	On the NATO conference, well I mean the obvious question is why should NATO exist?
GUM_interview_chomsky-14	In fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed, but now why should it exist.
GUM_interview_chomsky-15	I mean the theory was, whether you believe it or not, that it would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression, that’s the basic doctrine.
GUM_interview_chomsky-16	Well there’s no defense against Soviet aggression, so whether you believe that doctrine or not that’s gone.
GUM_interview_chomsky-17	When the Soviet Union collapsed there had been an agreement, a recent agreement, between Gorbachev and the U.S government and the first Bush administration.
GUM_interview_chomsky-18	The agreement was that Gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession: he agreed to let a united Germany join the NATO military alliance.
GUM_interview_chomsky-19	Now it is remarkable in the light of history, the history of the past century, Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia, twice, and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance, centered in the most phenomenal military power in history, that’s a real threat.
GUM_interview_chomsky-20	Nevertheless he agreed, but there was a quid pro quo, namely that NATO should not expand to the east, so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone.
GUM_interview_chomsky-21	And George Bush and James Baker, secretary of state, agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east.
GUM_interview_chomsky-22	Gorbachev also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region, but the U.S wouldn’t consider that.
GUM_interview_chomsky-23	Okay, so that was the basis on which then shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed.
GUM_interview_chomsky-24	Well, Clinton came into office what did he do?
GUM_interview_chomsky-25	Well one of the first things he did was to back down on the promise of not expanding NATO to the east.
GUM_interview_chomsky-26	Well that’s a significant threat to the Soviet Union, to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union, it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity, not much but some.
GUM_interview_chomsky-27	So they rescinded their pledge not to use nuclear weapons on first strike, NATO had never rescinded it, but they had and started some remilitarization.
GUM_interview_chomsky-28	With Bush, the aggressive militarism of the Bush administration, as predicted, induced Russia to extend further its offensive military capacity; it’s still going on right now.
GUM_interview_chomsky-29	When Bush proposed the missile defense systems in Eastern Europe, Poland and Czechoslovakia, it was a real provocation to the Soviet Union.
GUM_interview_chomsky-30	I mean that was discussed in U.S arms control journals, that they would have to regard as a potential threat to their strategic deterrent, meaning as a first strike weapon.
GUM_interview_chomsky-31	And the claim was that it had to do with Iranian missiles, but forget about that.
GUM_interview_chomsky-32	Take say on Obama, Obama’s national security advisor James Jones former Marine commandant is on record of favoring expansion of NATO to the south and the east, further expansion of NATO, and also making it an intervention force.
GUM_interview_chomsky-33	And the head of NATO, Hoop Scheffer, he has explained that NATO must take on responsibility for ensuring the security of pipelines and sea lanes, that is NATO must be a guarantor of energy supplies for the West.
GUM_interview_chomsky-34	Well that’s kind of an unending war, so do we want NATO to exist, do we want there to be a Western military alliance that carries out these activities, with no pretense of defense?
GUM_interview_chomsky-35	Well I think that’s a pretty good question; I don’t see why it should, I mean there happens to be no other military alliance remotely comparable — if there happened to be one I’d be opposed to that too.
GUM_interview_chomsky-36	So I think the first question is, what is this all about, why should we even be debating NATO, is there any reason why it should exist?
GUM_interview_chomsky-37	Labor actions as a revival of the Left
GUM_interview_chomsky-38	We’ve seen mass strikes all around the world, in countries that we wouldn’t expect it.
GUM_interview_chomsky-39	Do you think this is a revival of the Left in the West?
GUM_interview_chomsky-40	Or do you think it’s nothing?
GUM_interview_chomsky-41	It’s really hard to tell.
GUM_interview_chomsky-42	I mean there’s certainly signs of it, and in the United States too, in fact we had a sit down strike in the United States not long ago, which is a very militant labor action.
GUM_interview_chomsky-43	Sit down strikes which began at a significant level in the 1930’s were very threatening to management and ownership, because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management, and probably doing a better job.
GUM_interview_chomsky-44	So that’s a frightening idea, and police were called in and so on.
GUM_interview_chomsky-45	Well we just had one in the United States at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory, it’s hard to know, I mean these things are just hard to predict, they may take off, and they may take on a broader scope, they may fizzle away or be diverted.
GUM_interview_cocktail-1	Wikinews interviews New York bar owner on Santorum cocktail
GUM_interview_cocktail-2	Thursday, March 15, 2012
GUM_interview_cocktail-3	Wikinews interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink called Santorum.
GUM_interview_cocktail-4	The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality;
GUM_interview_cocktail-5	Savage's readers voted to define santorum as; "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."
GUM_interview_cocktail-6	Background
GUM_interview_cocktail-7	The santorum neologism has inspired satirical forms of parody, including this political cartoon by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal webcomic artist Zach Weiner.
GUM_interview_cocktail-8	2012.
GUM_interview_cocktail-9	Image; Zach Weiner.
GUM_interview_cocktail-10	The Pacific Standard bar is located in Brooklyn, New York, and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg.
GUM_interview_cocktail-11	Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail, "When he was winning in the polls, I thought, 'OK, I'll do a Santorum'."
GUM_interview_cocktail-12	Regarding how long the beverage will be made available, Stan remarked to The Brooklyn Paper, "We'll keep it around until he’s irrelevant. I hope he’s there the whole way".
GUM_interview_cocktail-13	The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety, Baileys Irish Cream, and Angostura bitters.
GUM_interview_cocktail-14	It is served in a cocktail glass and topped with Godiva chocolate flakes.
GUM_interview_cocktail-15	The beverage is priced at US $ 8.00, and upon an order for it, the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism.
GUM_interview_cocktail-16	Troy Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar.
GUM_interview_cocktail-17	After tasting the beverage, Patterson observed, "My Santorum was sweet but balanced, with a subtle citrus pucker".
GUM_interview_cocktail-18	[The santorum neologism is] offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it. — Rick Santorum
GUM_interview_cocktail-19	In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press, Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality.
GUM_interview_cocktail-20	Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator’s last name, and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon.
GUM_interview_cocktail-21	The term became a prominent result in searches online, and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!.
GUM_interview_cocktail-22	Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google's response;
GUM_interview_cocktail-23	"To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle.
GUM_interview_cocktail-24	I suspect that's not true."
GUM_interview_cocktail-25	Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview, saying, "It's offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it. "

GUM_interview_cocktail-29	Interview
GUM_interview_cocktail-30	What inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism?
GUM_interview_cocktail-31	Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary season, and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of "santorum. "
GUM_interview_cocktail-32	How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column?
GUM_interview_cocktail-33	We don't really remember.
GUM_interview_cocktail-34	It's been around forever.
GUM_interview_cocktail-35	Probably read about it somewhere.
GUM_interview_cocktail-36	What are your thoughts about Rick Santorum’s views on gay rights?
GUM_interview_cocktail-37	It's not for us to take a stand on any political issues.
GUM_interview_cocktail-38	We'll leave that to the professionals.
GUM_interview_cocktail-39	Do you think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column?
GUM_interview_cocktail-40	We thought it was funny.
GUM_interview_cocktail-41	Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide.
GUM_interview_cocktail-42	When was the Santorum cocktail first created?
GUM_interview_cocktail-43	A few months ago.
GUM_interview_cocktail-44	What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail?
GUM_interview_cocktail-45	Bailey's, orange vodka, bitters, and chocolate flakes.
GUM_interview_cocktail-46	How is the Santorum drink made?
GUM_interview_cocktail-47	The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass.
GUM_interview_cocktail-48	See the pictures.
GUM_interview_cocktail-49	Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including; The Brooklyn Paper, The New York Times, Jezebel, Metro.us, EDGE on the Net, and Instinct Magazine.
GUM_interview_cocktail-50	Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage?
GUM_interview_cocktail-51	Not at all.
GUM_interview_cocktail-52	We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy.
GUM_interview_cocktail-53	What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail?
GUM_interview_cocktail-54	You'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time, so something sweet; ice cream or pie.
GUM_interview_cocktail-55	Is the drink popular?
GUM_interview_cocktail-56	How many times do you suppose you’ve served it at your establishment since its creation?
GUM_interview_cocktail-57	The drink was mildly popular for the last few months, but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity.
GUM_interview_cocktail-58	We have no way to estimate how many times we've served it overall, but we 're now pouring around ten a night.
GUM_interview_daly-1	Cold as ice: Wikinews interviews Marymegan Daly on unusual new sea anemone
GUM_interview_daly-2	Tuesday, January 21, 2014
GUM_interview_daly-3	How did you come to be involved with this discovery
GUM_interview_daly-4	Frank Rack got in touch after they returned from Antarctica in hopes that I could help with an identification on the anemone.
GUM_interview_daly-5	What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea?
GUM_interview_daly-6	I was amazed and really excited.
GUM_interview_daly-7	I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate, because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something.
GUM_interview_daly-8	The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because, given our lack of data, we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like, or what it shouldn't be like.
GUM_interview_daly-9	There's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015, with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists.
GUM_interview_daly-10	Are you intending to go there yourself?
GUM_interview_daly-11	I would love to.
GUM_interview_daly-12	But I am also happy to not go, as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf!
GUM_interview_daly-13	What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways, but it doesn't require me to be there.
GUM_interview_daly-14	Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live, and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones, ship time is expensive, especially in Antarctica, and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there, they should have priority to be there.
GUM_interview_daly-15	These animals are shrouded in mystery.
GUM_interview_daly-16	Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical; do they produce some kind of antifreeze, and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own?
GUM_interview_daly-17	Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand.
GUM_interview_daly-18	The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin (a kind of formaldehyde solution).
GUM_interview_daly-19	The formalin is great for preserving structures, but for anemones, it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body.
GUM_interview_daly-20	This means we can't look at the issue you raise with these animals.
GUM_interview_daly-21	What we could do, however, was to study anatomy and figure out what it is, so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g., the genome, transcriptome, or metabolome, or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves, we can make precise comparisons, and figure out what these animals have or do (metabolically or chemically) that lets them live where they live.
GUM_interview_daly-22	Just knowing a whole lot about a single species isn't very useful, even if that animal is as special as these clearly are -
GUM_interview_daly-23	we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way.
GUM_interview_daly-24	The only way to get at what's different is to make comparisons with close relatives.
GUM_interview_daly-25	We can start that side of the work now, anticipating having more beasts in the future.
GUM_interview_daly-26	In terms of their glow, I suspect that it's not theirs -
GUM_interview_daly-27	although luminescence is common in anemone relatives, they don't usually make light themselves.
GUM_interview_daly-28	They do make a host of florescent proteins, and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow.
GUM_interview_daly-29	What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used?
GUM_interview_daly-30	I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal's external anatomy and overall body organization (magnification of 60 X).
GUM_interview_daly-31	I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome, mounted the slices on microscope slides, stained the slices to enhance contrast, and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope
GUM_interview_daly-32	(that's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper).
GUM_interview_daly-33	I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules (= nematocysts).
GUM_interview_daly-34	I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group.
GUM_interview_daly-35	This step seems trivial, but it is really the most important part!
GUM_interview_daly-36	By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found, I figured out what group it belongs to, and was able to determine that within that group, it was a new species.
GUM_interview_daly-37	It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication, why did it take so long?
GUM_interview_daly-38	You mean, how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly, right? :)
GUM_interview_daly-39	It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out.
GUM_interview_daly-40	Some of that time was just lost time -
GUM_interview_daly-41	I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish.
GUM_interview_daly-42	Once we figured out what it was, we played a lot of manuscript email tag, which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel, field work, etc.
GUM_interview_daly-43	Manuscript review and processing took about four months.
GUM_interview_daly-44	What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used, and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA?
GUM_interview_daly-45	The preservation was not unorthodox -
GUM_interview_daly-46	they followed best practices for anatomical preservation.
GUM_interview_daly-47	Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes, or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold.
GUM_interview_daly-48	I am curious about the population structure of the "fields" of anemones -
GUM_interview_daly-49	the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually, and it's possible that the fields are "clones" produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction.
GUM_interview_daly-50	DNA is the only way to test this.
GUM_interview_daly-51	This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic, and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station
GUM_interview_daly-52	image: Daily et al.
GUM_interview_daly-53	Daly explained how she obtained these images of the anemone's anatomy.

GUM_interview_dungeon-1	BDSM as business: An interview with the owners of a dungeon
GUM_interview_dungeon-2	Sunday, October 21, 2007
GUM_interview_dungeon-3	Operating the business
GUM_interview_dungeon-4	The costs
GUM_interview_dungeon-5	Clothing supply closet.
GUM_interview_dungeon-6	There's a misconception in this industry.
GUM_interview_dungeon-7	Your exposure to this is probably primarily what you see in movies, scanning magazines, scanning the Internet, just snippets everywhere.
GUM_interview_dungeon-8	It's portrayed as though it's dark, black and evil.
GUM_interview_dungeon-9	And --
GUM_interview_dungeon-10	Oh man, well?
GUM_interview_dungeon-11	What's up?
GUM_interview_dungeon-12	I do wear a lot of black.
GUM_interview_dungeon-13	It's anything but that.
GUM_interview_dungeon-14	If you look at the rooms, there's all the accouterments you'd find in these types of places --
GUM_interview_dungeon-15	but more than anything, there's a lot of good feeling around here.
GUM_interview_dungeon-16	We hire the opposite of what you'd think we would hire, what the average person would think we would hire.
GUM_interview_dungeon-17	We hire educated, nice people.
GUM_interview_dungeon-18	I remember one of our ads that I had put in said, "If you think nice girls don't do S&M," -- I forgot what the rest of it said --
GUM_interview_dungeon-19	"-- think again."
GUM_interview_dungeon-20	Yeah, "think again" or something like that.
GUM_interview_dungeon-21	And that ad had pulled so many girls, because they -- I think they all thought that nice girls don't do this.
GUM_interview_dungeon-22	And a bunch of them had called and they said, "Wow."
GUM_interview_dungeon-23	And I think I remember, a bunch of guys called because of that also.
GUM_interview_dungeon-24	Do you remember?
GUM_interview_dungeon-25	I sure do, I sure do.
GUM_interview_dungeon-26	What are the startup costs involved?
GUM_interview_dungeon-27	It varies; look around Manhattan, look around rents, look around build-outs, look around hiring, look around advertising ...
GUM_interview_dungeon-28	What's your greatest non-fixed cost?
GUM_interview_dungeon-29	The single most costly thing we spend on is rent and advertising, those two together make up the bulk of what we spend.
GUM_interview_dungeon-30	There's supplies, and there's wear and tear and maintenance, and bookkeeping and things like that that you have to do.
GUM_interview_dungeon-31	That's about it.
GUM_interview_dungeon-32	The hardest thing in running this business, which is why people can't do it, is the relationship that my wife has with the gals and with the customers.
GUM_interview_dungeon-33	Where do you advertise?
GUM_interview_dungeon-34	A lot on the web, we've used most of the local city papers, New York Press, things like that, L Magazine.
GUM_interview_dungeon-35	In the back of the paper?
GUM_interview_dungeon-36	Typically in the back of the paper.
GUM_interview_dungeon-37	Magazines constantly change their policy on it; they want it, they don't want it ...
GUM_interview_dungeon-38	Depending on the election year --
GUM_interview_dungeon-39	Who's buying the paper, who's selling the paper.
GUM_interview_dungeon-40	So it changes, so one year we got to be in the Press, but they have now stopped adult ads.
GUM_interview_dungeon-41	Completely.
GUM_interview_dungeon-42	So now we'll be in the Voice for a while.
GUM_interview_dungeon-43	We 're moving more towards the Internet at this point, because the Internet is a much easier, safer way for a person to look at sensitive material and not get caught with it.
GUM_interview_dungeon-44	Hiring employees
GUM_interview_dungeon-45	Personality test questions given to prospective mistresses.
GUM_interview_dungeon-46	Pursuant to your business question: we only hire nice people.
GUM_interview_dungeon-47	I don't care if a girl is absolutely exquisite looking --
GUM_interview_dungeon-48	My husband has met beautiful, beautiful girls --
GUM_interview_dungeon-49	-- beautiful girls --
GUM_interview_dungeon-50	-- and he's in the end, he would say, "Well, I won't hire them."
GUM_interview_dungeon-51	I'm like, ‘Are you insane?
GUM_interview_dungeon-52	I won't hire them. I hire --
GUM_interview_dungeon-53	Why not?
GUM_interview_dungeon-54	Because I want someone who's going to treat people nicely and well.
GUM_interview_dungeon-55	We have --
GUM_interview_dungeon-56	How can you tell whether they will or will not?
GUM_interview_dungeon-57	Just by talking to them?
GUM_interview_dungeon-58	Having been a psychologist for a number of years gives me a leg up on it.
GUM_interview_dungeon-59	And he's been right.
GUM_interview_dungeon-60	And I have made him hire these girls, and ultimately he's been right
GUM_interview_dungeon-61	They've been complete pain in the asses!
GUM_interview_dungeon-62	I also have a profile they fill out for me, a mini-MMPI that I developed, so that I have an idea -- Rebecca and I put it together
GUM_interview_dungeon-63	I don't know if you'd like to see one.
GUM_interview_dungeon-64	No, no, no. Just --
GUM_interview_dungeon-65	I could show you.
GUM_interview_dungeon-66	So I have a mini-MMPI that I --
GUM_interview_dungeon-67	Could I have a sample, not necessarily one that's filled out, but just one that you --
GUM_interview_dungeon-68	I'll show you.
GUM_interview_dungeon-69	The questions are --
GUM_interview_dungeon-70	Be careful.
GUM_interview_dungeon-71	He'll make you fill one out.
GUM_interview_dungeon-72	You'd be scared.
GUM_interview_dungeon-73	You wouldn't hire me.
GUM_interview_dungeon-74	Is it only girls you hire?
GUM_interview_dungeon-75	Yeah.
GUM_interview_dungeon-76	What would a question like "the greatest woman in the world" reveal to you?
GUM_interview_dungeon-77	No question would reveal anything independently of all the questions together --
GUM_interview_dungeon-78	Sure.
GUM_interview_dungeon-79	-- but I have a chart that I'll go through; the MMPI.
GUM_interview_dungeon-80	The baseline data that I use to --
GUM_interview_dungeon-81	How did you originate these questions?
GUM_interview_dungeon-82	Where did I make them?
GUM_interview_dungeon-83	You get a baseline from asking girls and refining profiles --
GUM_interview_dungeon-84	And it's an amalgamation of questions.
GUM_interview_dungeon-85	Of many, many questions --
GUM_interview_dungeon-86	What's your favorite question?
GUM_interview_dungeon-87	I don't know, the O.J. Simpson ….
GUM_interview_dungeon-88	Yeah, I see O.J. Simpson.
GUM_interview_dungeon-89	What would that be an indicator of?
GUM_interview_dungeon-90	I'm not sure which one you gave him, but there's a brief, brief, brief IQ test there.
GUM_interview_dungeon-91	Very brief.
GUM_interview_dungeon-92	Do you ask for references?
GUM_interview_dungeon-93	No, because I really can't call and tell them I'm yeah, so-and-so's applying here for a position.
GUM_interview_herrick-1	Jack Herrick, wikiHow founder interviewed by Wikinews
GUM_interview_herrick-2	Saturday, January 31, 2009
GUM_interview_herrick-3	Herrick at RecentChangesCamp 2008 Image: ShakataGaNai.
GUM_interview_herrick-4	wikiHow is a wiki-based site which aims to "build the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual. "
GUM_interview_herrick-5	It recently published its 50,000th article, and to discuss what the site has achieved since its creation, Wikinews interviewed the site's founder, Jack Herrick.
GUM_interview_herrick-6	In the interview, Herrick explains what wikiHow is, why he decided to create it, how he grew it in size, and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license (HyperLink) for his site.
GUM_interview_herrick-7	Read below for more of the interview in full.
GUM_interview_herrick-8	Interview
GUM_interview_herrick-9	For our readers who are unaware of your site, could you briefly explain what wikiHow is?
GUM_interview_herrick-10	Sure.
GUM_interview_herrick-11	wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual.
GUM_interview_herrick-12	Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language.
GUM_interview_herrick-13	We 're quite far from our goals currently, but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger
GUM_interview_herrick-14	We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles.
GUM_interview_herrick-15	We hope that in time, we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status.
GUM_interview_herrick-16	That said, we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve.
GUM_interview_herrick-17	However, in terms of readership, we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia.
GUM_interview_herrick-18	We get over 14 million unique visitors per month (source: Google Analytics), which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast.
GUM_interview_herrick-19	[Note: The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met]
GUM_interview_herrick-20	Like Wikipedia, wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software.
GUM_interview_herrick-21	Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world.
GUM_interview_herrick-22	That said, we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects:
GUM_interview_herrick-23	We are much smaller.
GUM_interview_herrick-24	The English wikiHow has only 60 admins, compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia.
GUM_interview_herrick-25	As a result, wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors.
GUM_interview_herrick-26	We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good.
GUM_interview_herrick-27	This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation.
GUM_interview_herrick-28	We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations.
GUM_interview_herrick-29	Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons.
GUM_interview_herrick-30	(http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity).
GUM_interview_herrick-31	In addition, we've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral.
GUM_interview_herrick-32	(http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral)
GUM_interview_herrick-33	Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility.
GUM_interview_herrick-34	As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online.
GUM_interview_herrick-35	Why did you decide to create wikiHow?
GUM_interview_herrick-36	I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person.
GUM_interview_herrick-37	Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine.
GUM_interview_herrick-38	How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity?
GUM_interview_herrick-39	I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world.
GUM_interview_herrick-40	Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful.
GUM_interview_herrick-41	I've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow.
GUM_interview_herrick-42	My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow.
GUM_interview_herrick-43	eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world.
GUM_interview_herrick-44	eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software.
GUM_interview_herrick-45	When I ran eHow, the content was professionally produced and edited.
GUM_interview_herrick-46	This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets.
GUM_interview_herrick-47	However, paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices.
GUM_interview_herrick-48	You either 1) sacrifice on breadth and don't produce the topics that won't interest advertisers, or 2) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that doesn't cost much to write.
GUM_interview_herrick-49	I wasn't interested in making either of these sacrifices, as I think the world's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive.
GUM_interview_herrick-50	So ultimately I decided that eHow's model would not build the resource I envisioned.
GUM_interview_herrick-51	When I discovered Wikipedia, I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs.
GUM_interview_herrick-52	So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow.
GUM_interview_herrick-53	Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license?
GUM_interview_herrick-54	We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork).
GUM_interview_herrick-55	In my opinion, people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the "right to leave."
GUM_interview_herrick-56	If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction, they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere.
GUM_interview_herrick-57	This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license.
GUM_interview_herrick-58	This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow, the company, will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community.
GUM_interview_herrick-59	I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far.
GUM_interview_herrick-60	My hope is that over time, internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others.
GUM_interview_herrick-61	That said, when we started out I didn't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver's license.
GUM_interview_herrick-62	As a result, we made some mistakes along the path.
GUM_interview_herrick-63	In retrospect, I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC.
GUM_interview_herrick-64	At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects.
GUM_interview_herrick-65	wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month.
GUM_interview_herrick-66	How did you grow the site to the size it is today?
GUM_interview_herrick-67	In December 2008, wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics (Full data: http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics).
GUM_interview_herrick-68	Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US.
GUM_interview_herrick-69	(http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com).
GUM_interview_herrick-70	wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons.
GUM_interview_herrick-71	First, people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information.
GUM_interview_herrick-72	People want to learn more practical skills, and for the most part the internet doesn't provide enough quality information yet.
GUM_interview_herrick-73	Second, we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing: We had some articles of mixed quality, and editors joined to improve those articles, which in turn attracted more readers.
GUM_interview_herrick-74	We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle: More readers, means more editors, which creates better instructions, leading again to more readers.
GUM_interview_herrick-75	It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed.
GUM_interview_licen-1	Wikinews interviews academic Simon Ličen about attitudes towards US Paralympics
GUM_interview_licen-2	Saturday, November 16, 2013
GUM_interview_licen-3	A Russian stamp for Paralympic Games in Sochi in 2014
GUM_interview_licen-4	On Thursday, with 110 days until the start of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, Wikinews interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership, Sport Studies and Educational / Counseling Psychology at Washington State University Simon Ličen about attitudes in United States towards the Paralympics.
GUM_interview_licen-5	Ličen has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents.
GUM_interview_licen-6	Originally from Slovenia, he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission.
GUM_interview_licen-7	He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team.
GUM_interview_licen-8	Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and even Canada?
GUM_interview_licen-9	Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society.
GUM_interview_licen-10	It emphasizes consumerism, the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities, dedication and qualifications, and reinforces, rather than changes, existing ideas related to gender, ethnicity and nationality.
GUM_interview_licen-11	Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled.
GUM_interview_licen-12	Although disability is not contagious, interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it.
GUM_interview_licen-13	Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication, hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to.
GUM_interview_licen-14	Other countries, including the ones you mention, have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society.
GUM_interview_licen-15	Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act, many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity.
GUM_interview_licen-16	What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time?
GUM_interview_licen-17	The impact depends on a number of aspects.
GUM_interview_licen-18	One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on.
GUM_interview_licen-19	Will they be shown nationally or regionally, on NBC or on any of the company’s multiple cable networks?
GUM_interview_licen-20	A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown.
GUM_interview_licen-21	Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York, and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast.
GUM_interview_licen-22	So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night, and evening prime-time events will be shown — indeed live — in the morning U.S. time.
GUM_interview_licen-23	So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears.
GUM_interview_licen-24	A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated: will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics?
GUM_interview_licen-25	Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others — for better and worse?
GUM_interview_licen-26	Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity?
GUM_interview_licen-27	All in all, I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-1	Friday, January 3, 2014
GUM_interview_mckenzie-2	Preston, Victoria, Australia
GUM_interview_mckenzie-3	On Saturday, Wikinews interviewed Tina McKenzie, a former member of the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, known as the Gliders.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-4	McKenzie, a silver and bronze Paralympic medalist in wheelchair basketball, retired from the game after the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-5	Wikinews caught up with her in a cafe in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Preston.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-6	[The Spitfire Tournament in Canada] was a really good tournament actually.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-7	It was a tournament that I wish we'd actually gone back to more often.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-8	Who plays in that one?
GUM_interview_mckenzie-9	It's quite a large Canadian tournament, and so we went as the Gliders team.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-10	So we were trying to get as many international games as possible.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-11	Cause that's one of our problems really, to compete.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-12	It costs us so much money to for us to travel overseas and to compete internationally.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-13	And so we can compete against each other all the time within Australia but we really need to be able to ...
GUM_interview_mckenzie-14	It's not the same.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-15	No, it's really not, so it's really important to be able to get as a many international trips throughout the year to continue our improvement.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-16	Also see where all the other teams are at as well.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-17	But yes, Spitfire was good.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-18	We took quite a few new girls over there back then in 2005, leading into the World Cup in the Netherlands.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-19	Was that the one where you were the captain of the team, in 2005?
GUM_interview_mckenzie-20	Or was that a later one?
GUM_interview_mckenzie-21	No, I captained in 2010.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-22	So 2009, 2010 World Cup.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-23	And then I had a bit of some time off in 2011.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-24	The Gliders have never won the World Championship.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-25	We always seem to have just a little bit of a chill out at the World Cup.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-26	I don't know why.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-27	It's really strange occurrence, over the years.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-28	2002 World Cup, we won bronze.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-29	Then in 2006 we ended up fourth.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-30	It was one of the worst World Cups we've played actually.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-31	And then in 2010 we just ... I don't know what happened.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-32	We just didn't play as well as we thought we would.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-33	Came fourth.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-34	But you know what?
GUM_interview_mckenzie-35	Fired us up for the actual Paralympics.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-36	So the World Cup is ... it's good to be able to do well at the World Cup, to be placed, but it also means that you get a really good opportunity to know where you 're at in that two year gap between the Paralympics.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-37	So you can come back home and revisit what you need to do and, you know, where the team's at.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-38	And all that sort of stuff.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-39	Unfortunately, they are talking about moving it so it will be on the year before the Paralympics.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-40	Oh really.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-41	The competition from the [FIFA] World Cup and all.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-42	Right.
GUM_interview_mckenzie-43	Well, that would be sad.

GUM_interview_messina-1	Frank Messina: An Interview with the 'Mets Poet'
GUM_interview_messina-2	Wednesday, October 3, 2007
GUM_interview_messina-3	You have received a good deal of attention recently.
GUM_interview_messina-4	Even though Im not Michael Jackson or somebody, when people come up to me and introduce themselves and say, 'Hey Frank, my name is John,' I say, 'Hey John, my name is Frank' and they laugh.
GUM_interview_messina-5	It's a funny phenomenon.
GUM_interview_messina-6	What goes through your head when that happens?
GUM_interview_messina-7	I understand it.
GUM_interview_messina-8	I've gone to readings and concerts.
GUM_interview_messina-9	I look at it as human interaction.
GUM_interview_messina-10	Over the years I have performed in 32 countries and 40 states.
GUM_interview_messina-11	I've been doing this professionally since I was in my twenties, and before that since I was sixteen doing little tidbit poetry readings in coffeehouses.
GUM_interview_messina-12	The band I started in 1993, Spoken Motion, received a lot of recognition as a spoken word band born out of the New York spoken word scene.
GUM_interview_messina-13	I worked with some great musicians and performed around the world.
GUM_interview_messina-14	I remember signing my first autograph to a kid when I was 25 years old.
GUM_interview_messina-15	As time went on, I came out with books and CDs, and I became used to that kind of thing.
GUM_interview_messina-16	To me, the ultimate feeling of success as an artist, is to move somebody enough where they thank you.
GUM_interview_messina-17	When someone comes up and says, 'Frank, thank you, your work is great."
GUM_interview_messina-18	You have a long career in poetry, but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets-inspired work.
GUM_interview_messina-19	How do you feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work?
GUM_interview_messina-20	It's ironic.
GUM_interview_messina-21	Some of the greatest poetry has been born out of failure and the depths of adversity in the human experience.
GUM_interview_messina-22	Walt Whitman, the first great American poet, wrote about the Civil War.
GUM_interview_messina-23	He went looking for his brother, George Whitman, after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South.
GUM_interview_messina-24	When he started out his poems were about beating drums, and blow, bugle, blow.
GUM_interview_messina-25	Real patriotic.
GUM_interview_messina-26	Then he started to see the real horrors of war.
GUM_interview_messina-27	He was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time.
GUM_interview_messina-28	Eventually when he found his brother he had resolution.
GUM_interview_messina-29	I experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer.
GUM_interview_messina-30	I loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero.
GUM_interview_messina-31	I turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now.
GUM_interview_messina-32	When I wrote my 9/11-related poems, that was true adversity.
GUM_interview_messina-33	I realize baseball is just a game.
GUM_interview_messina-34	Can you recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now?
GUM_interview_messina-35	This was a piece that the Times only quoted one stanza, but it's about preparation for a battle, and being prepared to either rise to the occasion, or go down:
GUM_interview_messina-36	Do you know what it's like to be chased by the Ghost of Failure while staring through Victory's door?
GUM_interview_messina-37	Of course you do, you 're a Mets fan caught in a do-or-die moment in late September at Shea
GUM_interview_messina-38	As one thats battled hard through many a broken dream Let me say, "in order to rise to the occasion you must be willing to go down with the ship",
GUM_interview_messina-39	Have no fear, no hesitation, for Winning shall be it's reward!
GUM_interview_messina-40	Don't let them get in your head!
GUM_interview_messina-41	you've kept it up this long
GUM_interview_messina-42	You 're a Mets fan in late September and youll fight til the glorious end
GUM_interview_messina-43	Cheer the team today; (your boys in orange and blue) Let them hear you shout as they fight for what's mightily due
GUM_interview_messina-44	(copyright Frank Messina; reprinted with permission)"
GUM_interview_messina-45	Sports fans aren't known as patrons of poetry.
GUM_interview_messina-46	Have you had interaction with "new readers' through your Mets work?
GUM_interview_messina-47	This one person who I never met took a picture of me and sent it to me in an e-mail.
GUM_interview_messina-48	The e-mail said, 'Frank, I have never bothered you during the game, but I just wanted to say thank you for your work and thank you for making some sense of the successes and failures and I wish you much success with your work.'
GUM_interview_messina-49	Last year in my section at the stadium I had a banner that read We Know'.
GUM_interview_messina-50	That's all it said.
GUM_interview_messina-51	Then earlier this year these shirts started to come out that said, "Poet says We Know".
GUM_interview_messina-52	It was amazing.
GUM_interview_messina-53	We didn't use the banner this year, though, because we didn't know.
GUM_interview_messina-54	The team wasn't so far ahead that we knew.
GUM_interview_messina-55	Last year we just knew we were going to the playoffs; we knew we were going post-season.
GUM_interview_messina-56	This year we weren't sure.
GUM_interview_messina-57	We were walking on eggshells.
GUM_interview_messina-58	There was a woman, a season ticket holder and a die hard fan.
GUM_interview_messina-59	She was staggered by the loss last year to the Cardinals.
GUM_interview_messina-60	Last year she came up to me during one of the games late in the season; she was so happy we were going to the post season.
GUM_interview_messina-61	By that point we had clinched it.
GUM_interview_messina-62	She handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug.
GUM_interview_messina-63	With tears in her eyes she said, "Thank you, Mets Poet, thank you."
GUM_interview_messina-64	It's cool ... it's like another family.
GUM_interview_messina-65	Moments like that must make you realize you have touched people who aren't normally touched by poetry.
GUM_interview_messina-66	It's opened up a new fan base, so to speak.
GUM_interview_messina-67	For the last year SNY has broadcast footage of me with my poems, so quite a few fans known about the "Mets Poet'.
GUM_interview_messina-68	I have never called myself that, by the way.
GUM_interview_messina-69	The back of my jersey says "The Poet' because growing up that was my nickname.
GUM_interview_messina-70	My brother was a runner and they used to call him The Birdman -- Birdie -- and they called me The Poet.
GUM_interview_messina-71	It was a natural thing, but I never coined myself as 'The Mets Poet.'
GUM_interview_onion-1	The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'
GUM_interview_onion-2	Sunday, November 25, 2007
GUM_interview_onion-3	How The Onion writes an issue
GUM_interview_onion-4	This exclusive interview features first-hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter.
GUM_interview_onion-5	See the collaboration page for more details.
GUM_interview_onion-6	How do you decide on the stories?
GUM_interview_onion-7	We do everything backwards here.
GUM_interview_onion-8	We start with the headline and then flesh out the story, as opposed to The New York Times, which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy.
GUM_interview_onion-9	We start with a joke.
GUM_interview_onion-10	We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside — a contributing core.
GUM_interview_onion-11	We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred, come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff; all fifteen of us.
GUM_interview_onion-12	Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute.
GUM_interview_onion-13	We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team, who adds the visual aspect to it.
GUM_interview_onion-14	The editors punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition.
GUM_interview_onion-15	So you don’t have writers coming up with a story and headline, but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved?
GUM_interview_onion-16	Writers will occasionally write their own headlines, but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas, what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people’s writing strengths are.
GUM_interview_onion-17	We have some people who are great at politics; some people we give all the war stuff to; someone who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week — the entertainment stories.
GUM_interview_onion-18	The headlines

GUM_interview_onion-21	It seems like some publications, like AM New York, always have a Britney Spears story;
GUM_interview_onion-22	is there anything similar with The Onion where they continually revisit a topic or person?
GUM_interview_onion-23	No, not necessarily.
GUM_interview_onion-24	We are a little less reactionary.
GUM_interview_onion-25	We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything.
GUM_interview_onion-26	We’ll hit the mainstream media’s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we’ll hit characters in the entertainment world.
GUM_interview_onion-27	We’ll attack People Magazine’s coverage of Britney as much as Britney.
GUM_interview_onion-28	In an interview with Terry Gross, Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City that they had decided on not doing political humor and, in particular, hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes.
GUM_interview_onion-29	They felt it was overdone, mean-spirited and not funny.
GUM_interview_onion-30	Do your writers have similar rules of thumb?
GUM_interview_onion-31	We don’t have any rules or known lines we won’t cross.
GUM_interview_onion-32	We have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years, and those writers training the new writers as they come in.
GUM_interview_onion-33	There is an understanding in the room.
GUM_interview_onion-34	If it makes the room laugh, it probably ends up in the paper.
GUM_interview_onion-35	One example is we ran an article a couple of years back that was, "No Jennifer Lopez News Today".
GUM_interview_onion-36	That was our reaction to all of the J-Lo stuff.
GUM_interview_onion-37	We weren’t going to touch on her dress, or who she was dating.
GUM_interview_onion-38	Just the fact that those were the lead stories for so many days, in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine.
GUM_interview_onion-39	I think it’s important we have an original take on those things.
GUM_interview_onion-40	I think it’s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross.
GUM_interview_onion-41	We don’t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle.
GUM_interview_onion-42	There’s a 24 hour comedy news cycle that exists on all the late night talk shows.
GUM_interview_onion-43	The Onion has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes.
GUM_interview_onion-44	We want an original take.
GUM_interview_onion-45	If we choose to do something on J-Lo, it’s going to be something like that, something less obvious.
GUM_interview_onion-46	When you are going through the headlines, is it just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up?
GUM_interview_onion-47	It’s the least amount of fun possible.
GUM_interview_onion-48	Nah, I’m kidding.
GUM_interview_onion-49	It’s actually more businesslike than you’d imagine.
GUM_interview_onion-50	It’s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh, but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now, so it takes a lot to make the room laugh.
GUM_interview_onion-51	The best analogy I’ve heard is when Rob Siegel, former editor-in-chief, likened it to wine tasting.
GUM_interview_onion-52	It’s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is, have we done anything like this, is it a unique take, what are other people doing.
GUM_interview_onion-53	It’s sort of like," Hmmm ... that’s hilarious. That’s really really funny" rather than people falling off their chairs.
GUM_interview_onion-54	It’s more subdued than I think what most people would expect.
GUM_interview_onion-55	It’s more analytical and clinical?
GUM_interview_onion-56	Not all the time, but it can’t be a laugh a minute.
GUM_interview_onion-57	Yeah, what you see on Studio 60 and 30 Rock, those are scripted writers rooms.
GUM_interview_onion-58	Everything is funny there.
GUM_interview_onion-59	There's a lot of unfunny jokes that are told in a back room, that's why they stay and die in that back room and don’t go out in The Onion.
GUM_interview_onion-60	If someone is continually telling unfunny jokes, do you eventually fire them?
GUM_interview_onion-61	That’s why we are on the 10th floor to make sure they die when they get kicked out.
GUM_interview_onion-62	It can be a real mess on Broadway.
GUM_interview_onion-63	By the time you get to be a writer for The Onion, though, the odds are you are going to succeed because we make it pretty challenging.
GUM_interview_onion-64	You go through quite a bit.
GUM_interview_onion-65	You will already have demonstrated a pretty long successful record of writing stuff for us before you will be in that room on a daily basis.
GUM_interview_onion-66	But if somebody wakes up one morning and suddenly no longer is funny, then yeah, head first, out the door as quickly as possible, and as sadistically as possible.
GUM_interview_shalev-1	Wikinews interviews Israeli mathematician and writer Aner Shalev
GUM_interview_shalev-2	Wednesday, September 19, 2007
GUM_interview_shalev-3	Aner Shalev is an Israeli mathematician and writer born in 1958 in Kibbutz Kinneret, Tiberias.
GUM_interview_shalev-4	Currently Shalev is a Professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Einstein Institute of Mathematics.
GUM_interview_shalev-5	At the moment Shalev is in Levico Terme, Trento, Italy for a conference.
GUM_interview_shalev-6	He was interviewed by Wikinews.
GUM_interview_shalev-7	Interview
GUM_interview_shalev-8	Aner Shalev
GUM_interview_shalev-9	What are you going to talk about here in Levico?
GUM_interview_shalev-10	I called it Character, walks and words.
GUM_interview_shalev-11	There is a whole topic which is called asymptotic groups theory.
GUM_interview_shalev-12	There are groups which express the symmetry of some structures.
GUM_interview_shalev-13	Studying groups is a bit like studying symmetry.
GUM_interview_shalev-14	It's very beautiful I think.
GUM_interview_shalev-15	And then when you do it in an asymptotic way is like you don't look at the small details.
GUM_interview_shalev-16	It's like from the sky.
GUM_interview_shalev-17	You look at the general patterns.
GUM_interview_shalev-18	And there is another topic which is very important in mathematics which is called representation theory.
GUM_interview_shalev-19	So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory to solve all kind of problems and conjectures in asymptotic groups theory.
GUM_interview_shalev-20	Why did you choose to study mathematics?
GUM_interview_shalev-21	First of all because it was beautiful.
GUM_interview_shalev-22	When I was ten my father already showed me some stuff in mathematics and the beauty and the imagination was quite apparent.
GUM_interview_shalev-23	I also like the freedom in mathematics.
GUM_interview_shalev-24	If you study physics or chemistry then you should describe the real world.
GUM_interview_shalev-25	But in mathematics you can build your own structures.
GUM_interview_shalev-26	You can walk in worlds created by the imagination of people.
GUM_interview_shalev-27	You 're not committed to the real world.
GUM_interview_shalev-28	It's almost like God to some extent.
GUM_interview_shalev-29	You can create worlds, you can study them.
GUM_interview_shalev-30	I think it's a combination of the beauty, of the imagination, of the freedom.
GUM_interview_shalev-31	Many people, and many students, dislike math.
GUM_interview_shalev-32	Why do you think it is so?
GUM_interview_shalev-33	First of all I think maybe they have bad teachers, which is a problem.
GUM_interview_shalev-34	You have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it.
GUM_interview_shalev-35	Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it – you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom, and the imagination, and creation.
GUM_interview_shalev-36	Maybe they don't like the precise nature of mathematics.
GUM_interview_shalev-37	Also when I talk mathematics I notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they don't know how to write a composition.
GUM_interview_shalev-38	They have ideas but they can notformulate them in the right way.
GUM_interview_shalev-39	Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world, but you can also create worlds of fiction.
GUM_interview_shalev-40	So you have imagination, you have total freedom, you can invent characters, you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another.
GUM_interview_shalev-41	Also the language is important in writing and in literature.
GUM_interview_shalev-42	So in a way people often don't know how to combine the two fields.
GUM_interview_shalev-43	It could look like almost the opposite: literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers.
GUM_interview_shalev-44	For example the most famous is Lewis Carrol, author of Alice in Wonderland.
GUM_interview_shalev-45	You 're not only a mathematician.
GUM_interview_shalev-46	You also wrote two collections of short stories and a novel.
GUM_interview_shalev-47	Why did you begin to write?
GUM_interview_shalev-48	When I was quite young I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams.
GUM_interview_shalev-49	I was trying to interpret my dreams.
GUM_interview_shalev-50	I started to write down my dreams.
GUM_interview_shalev-51	And then I noticed that I cheat a little bit when I write them down.
GUM_interview_shalev-52	Sometimes I make them more pretty then they were actually.
GUM_interview_shalev-53	So instead of documenting the dreams it gradually became also like adding creational elements, and I think that somehow through writing my dreams I gradually came to writing, also poems, but mainly stories.
GUM_interview_shalev-54	I'm a little bit inspired by dreams but when eventually I started to write more seriously I was more interested in structure which also .. a bit like mathematics in a way .. for example my first book is called Opus 1 .. a collection of four long stories with musical structures.
GUM_interview_shalev-55	The first part is called Legato and the second part was called Staccato.
GUM_interview_shalev-56	In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness.
GUM_interview_shalev-57	In the staccato part it's like a music: a lot of break, very very short sentences.
GUM_interview_shalev-58	It was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people.
GUM_interview_shalev-59	In the second book I made another experiment.
GUM_interview_shalev-60	It's a book of opening, Overtures I called it, and there is no end to the stories.
GUM_interview_shalev-61	There are seventy beginning of stories without ends.
GUM_interview_shalev-62	In the novel Dark Matters I think what interested me in the structure was two thing: simple narrative and email.
GUM_interview_shalev-63	It keeps changing between narrative and email.
GUM_interview_shalev-64	Another thing was two different time scapes: one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end.
GUM_interview_shalev-65	It's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle.
GUM_interview_shalev-66	... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot.
GUM_interview_shalev-67	Why did you choose this particular structure?
GUM_interview_shalev-68	When I tell stories I don't like that everything will be clear from the beginning.
GUM_interview_shalev-69	I like that something will be a bit of secret, or even unreliable narrator: someone tells something and first you trust him but then you read more and you become thrilled by everything.
GUM_interview_shalev-70	I think by using emails on the one hand which are more the voice of the woman Eva and narrative which is more the perspective of the man Adam, I kind of confront them, their different perspective and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way the story is told.
GUM_interview_shalev-71	I think that in this kind of structure there is a very gradual clarification of the relationship and the forth going on.
GUM_interview_stardust-1	Keep your eyes peeled for cosmic debris: Andrew Westphal about Stardust @ home
GUM_interview_stardust-2	Sunday, May 28, 2006
GUM_interview_stardust-3	Stardust is a NASA space capsule that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild (also known as "Wild 2) in deep space and landed back on Earth on January 15, 2006.
GUM_interview_stardust-4	It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used to "discover" the microscopically small samples the capsule collected.
GUM_interview_stardust-5	The project is called Stardust @ home.
GUM_interview_stardust-6	Unlike distributed computing projects like SETI @ home, Stardust @ home relies entirely on human intelligence.
GUM_interview_stardust-7	Andrew Westphal is the director of Stardust @ home.
GUM_interview_stardust-8	Wikinews interviewed him for May's Interview of the Month (IOTM) on May 18, 2006.
GUM_interview_stardust-9	As always, the interview was conducted on IRC, with multiple people asking questions.
GUM_interview_stardust-10	Some may not know exactly what Stardust or Stardust @ home is.
GUM_interview_stardust-11	Can you explain more about it for us?
GUM_interview_stardust-12	Artist's rendering of Spacecraft Stardust
GUM_interview_stardust-13	Image: NASA
GUM_interview_stardust-14	Stardust is a NASA Discovery mission that was launched in 1999.
GUM_interview_stardust-15	It is really two missions in one.
GUM_interview_stardust-16	The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar-system body, a comet called Wild 2 (pronounced "Vilt-two" — the discoverer was German, I believe).
GUM_interview_stardust-17	This is the first US "sample return" mission since Apollo, and the first ever from beyond the moon.
GUM_interview_stardust-18	This gives a little context.
GUM_interview_stardust-19	By "sample return" of course I mean a mission that brings back extraterrestrial material.
GUM_interview_stardust-20	I should have said above that this is the first "solid" sample return mission —
GUM_interview_stardust-21	Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago, but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium —
GUM_interview_stardust-22	basically this is a sample of the Galaxy.
GUM_interview_stardust-23	This is absolutely unprecedented, and we 're obviously incredibly excited.
GUM_interview_stardust-24	I should mention parenthetically that there is a fantastic launch video — taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website — highly recommended — best I've ever seen — all the way from the launch pad, too.
GUM_interview_stardust-25	Basically interplanetary trajectory.
GUM_interview_stardust-26	Absolutely great.
GUM_interview_stardust-27	Is the video available to the public?
GUM_interview_stardust-28	Yes [see below].
GUM_interview_stardust-29	OK, I digress.
GUM_interview_stardust-30	The first challenge that we have before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles is simply to find them.
GUM_interview_stardust-31	This is a big challenge because they are very small (order of micron in size) and are somewhere (we don't know where) on a HUGE collector — at least on the scale of the particle size — about a tenth of a square meter.
GUM_interview_stardust-32	So ...
GUM_interview_stardust-33	We 're right now using an automated microscope that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center.
GUM_interview_stardust-34	This is the ARES group that handles returned samples (Moon Rocks, Genesis chips, Meteorites, and Interplanetary Dust Particles collected by U2 in the stratosphere).
GUM_interview_stardust-35	The microscope collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array.
GUM_interview_stardust-36	These images are sent to us — we compress them and convert them into a format appropriate for Stardust @ home.
GUM_interview_stardust-37	Stardust @ home is a highly distributed project using a "Virtual Microscope" that is written in html and javascript and runs on most browsers — no downloads are required.
GUM_interview_stardust-38	Using the Virtual Microscope volunteers can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles.
GUM_interview_stardust-39	Aerogel slice removed with an ultrasonic blade, showing particle tracks.
GUM_interview_stardust-40	Image: NASA
GUM_interview_stardust-41	How many samples do you anticipate being found during the course of the project?
GUM_interview_stardust-42	Great question.
GUM_interview_stardust-43	The short answer is that we don't know.
GUM_interview_stardust-44	The long answer is a bit more complicated.
GUM_interview_stardust-45	Here's what we know.
GUM_interview_stardust-46	The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system.
GUM_interview_stardust-47	(This is a kind of "wind" of interstellar dust, caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium.)
GUM_interview_stardust-48	Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the "cruise" phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind.
GUM_interview_stardust-49	He estimated that there should be around 45 particles, but this number is very uncertain — I wouldn't be surprised if it is quite different from that.
GUM_interview_stardust-50	That was the long answer!
GUM_interview_stardust-51	One thing that I should say ... is that like all research, the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain.
GUM_interview_stardust-52	There is a wonderful quote attributed to Einstein — "If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called "research", would it?"
GUM_interview_stardust-53	How big would the samples be?
GUM_interview_stardust-54	We expect that the particles will be of order a micron in size.
GUM_interview_stardust-55	(A millionth of a meter.)
GUM_interview_stardust-56	When people are searching using the virtual microscope, they will be looking not for the particles, but for the tracks that the particles make, which are much larger — several microns in diameter.
GUM_interview_stardust-57	Just yesterday we switched over to a new site which has a demo of the VM (virtual microscope) I invite you to check it out.
GUM_interview_stardust-58	The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles that were shot into aerogel using a particle accelerator modified to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds, to simulate the interstellar dust impacts that we 're looking for.
GUM_interview_stardust-59	And that's on the main Stardust @ home website [see below]?
GUM_interview_stardust-60	Yes.
GUM_news_asylum-1	Over 900 asylum seekers rescued off Indonesian coast
GUM_news_asylum-2	Monday, May 18, 2015
GUM_news_asylum-3	On Friday, fishermen rescued over 700 asylum seekers whose boat sank, and the Indonesian Navy reportedly saved 200 more after they were found swimming along the coast of Aceh, Indonesia.
GUM_news_asylum-4	Major general Fuad Basya, spokesman for the Indonesian military, said fisherman first noticed the people and a warship was deployed to retrieve them.
GUM_news_asylum-5	The rescued members included Bangladeshis and Rohingya, a stateless minority of Muslims from Myanmar.
GUM_news_asylum-6	Myanmar is mainly Buddhist and the United Nations rates the Rohingya among the world's most persecuted groups.
GUM_news_asylum-7	According to ABC News, Basya also believes the asylum seekers found in the water may have left the boat on purpose to be rescued to avoid being sent away from Indonesia waters.
GUM_news_asylum-8	Malaysia and Indonesia have maintained a policy of turning away boats of migrants which, according to AFP, the Untied Nations and United States have both criticised.
GUM_news_asylum-9	One Rohingya, Muhammad Amin, the first boat rescued on Friday was turned around twice, toward Malaysia by Indonesian navy and then toward Indonesia by Malaysian navy.
GUM_news_asylum-10	Discussing his concern in a public statement, Malaysia's Prime Minister, Najib Razak said, "We are in contact with all relevant parties, with whom we share the desire to find a solution to this crisis".
GUM_news_asylum-11	Thailand has recently cracked down on human trafficking, which has affected the routes by which people-smugglers transport migrants.
GUM_news_asylum-12	The US State Department said John Kerry, the Secretary of State, contacted Thailand's foreign minister over temporary housing for the Rohingya out at sea.
GUM_news_asylum-13	Jeff Rathke, the State Department Spokesperson, said, "We urge the governments of the region to work together quickly, first and foremost, to save the lives of migrants now at sea who are in need of an immediate rescue effort".
GUM_news_asylum-14	Rathke also asked the governments of South East Asia not to turn away boats of people seeking asylum.
GUM_news_asylum-15	Estimates suggest 8000 migrants may be currently at sea in the region.

GUM_news_clock-2	Tuesday, September 22, 2015
GUM_news_clock-3	News of police response to a boy's digital clock in Texas last week has inspired a global social movement in support of the youth.
GUM_news_clock-4	Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old boy from Irving, Texas, was arrested at his school by police after he brought a digital clock he had made to school.
GUM_news_clock-5	After news of the police response was reported, Mohamed received support online ranging from US President Barack Obama to Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg.

GUM_news_clock-9	Mohamed brought the digital clock he made to school on September 14, and a teacher mistakenly thought it resembled a bomb.
GUM_news_clock-10	Police arrested and questioned the student.
GUM_news_clock-11	Images of the boy wearing a NASA T-shirt and handcuffed by the police were quickly posted and reposted online.
GUM_news_clock-12	The Deseret News observed that the hashtag on Twitter, #IStandWithAhmed, had become an international phenomenon.
GUM_news_clock-13	The Straits Times noted what began as individual messages to Mohamed had grown into a "support movement".
GUM_news_clock-14	American academic and professor Marc Lamont Hill commented,
GUM_news_clock-15	"Hoping that the #istandwithahmed movement translates into a substantive national conversation on race, punishment, and incarceration."
GUM_news_clock-16	The Twitter attention led to outreach from Google and Mohamed was invited to their Google Science Fair.
GUM_news_clock-17	Mohamed was a VIP guest at the Google Science Fair this weekend, and was able to meet finalists at the event held at Google's headquarters located in Mountain View, California.
GUM_news_clock-18	Co-founder of Google, Sergey Brin, personally met with Mohamed during his visit to Google.
GUM_news_clock-19	On Wednesday, Mohamed and his father are to travel to the United Nations.
GUM_news_clock-20	His father Mohamed El-Hassan Mohamed said he was taking his entire family to the U.N. headquarters in New York, because international dignitaries wanted to meet with his son and express their support.
GUM_news_clock-21	Psychology major at University of Texas Arlington Amneh Jafari heard of the incident and wanted to issue her support to Mohamed.
GUM_news_clock-22	She chose the hastag #IStandWithAhmed and posted to Twitter.
GUM_news_clock-23	Jafari said she felt Mohamed had been subject to Islamophobia and her hashtag created greater awareness about this issue.
GUM_news_clock-24	The hashtag took on a life of its own, and was used in messages on Twitter over one million times by Thursday night.
GUM_news_clock-25	NASA tweeted support of Ahmed Mohamed via its account International Space Station

GUM_news_clock-27	US President Barack Obama tweeted using his @POTUS account:
GUM_news_clock-28	"Cool clock, Ahmed.
GUM_news_clock-29	Want to bring it to the White House?
GUM_news_clock-30	We should inspire more kids like you to like science.
GUM_news_clock-31	It's what makes America great."
GUM_news_clock-32	Twitter gave Mohamed the option to come to their company for an internship.
GUM_news_clock-33	Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg tweeted to Mohamed and said the boy was welcome to come and tour the company.
GUM_news_clock-34	Executive director of the Dallas chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations Alia Salem said Mohamed wishes to use his newfound fame and attention to spotlight social causes including the treatment of Muslims in the United States.
GUM_news_clock-35	University of Texas Arlington Muslim Student Association president Sehar Memon said the large amount of positive feedback for Mohamed had helped make his situation much better.
GUM_news_clock-36	Memon also said she believed the social movement in reaction to Mohamed helped improve Muslim / non-Muslim.
GUM_news_clock-37	Both the Irving Independent School District and the Irving Police Department have asserted that the boy's religion and name were not a factor in the manner in which they approached the situation.

GUM_news_crane-4	A storm yesterday caused a crane to fall into Mecca's Grand Mosque, killing 107 or more and wounding 238, according to Saudi Arabia's Civil Defense Authority.
GUM_news_crane-5	Civil Defense Authority director General Suleiman al-Amr, in remarks to al-Ikhbariya television, said "All those who were wounded and the dead have been taken to hospital. There are no casualties left at the location."
GUM_news_crane-6	The accident, which occurred yesterday afternoon, was caused by strong winds and heavy rain that led the crane to fall.
GUM_news_crane-7	Photos released of the scene showed numerous bloodied bodies and various scattered debris.
GUM_news_crane-8	The accident occurred at a time when the mosque was relatively uncrowded.
GUM_news_crane-9	"Had it happened an hour later it would have been much worse," Khaled Al-Maeena, editor at large at the Saudi Gazette, said.
GUM_news_crane-10	"Had it happened five hours earlier or four hours earlier, I think the death toll would have been more than a thousand."
GUM_news_crane-11	The crane accident comes just ten days before the beginning of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest site.
GUM_news_crane-12	As undergoing a pilgrimage to Mecca is a mandatory religious duty for all Muslims who physically and financially can, millions of pilgrims arrive in Mecca each year for the Hajj.
GUM_news_crane-13	Construction was underway at the mosque in order to enlarge the mosque and improve crowd control, which has been a recurring problem during Mecca's pilgrimages.

GUM_news_flag-1	New Zealand begins process to consider changing national flag design
GUM_news_flag-2	Thursday, May 7, 2015
GUM_news_flag-3	On Tuesday, the New Zealand government announced the start of a public process to suggest designs for a new national flag, and determine whether their citizens would prefer a different national flag over the current one.
GUM_news_flag-4	The current flag of New Zealand.
GUM_news_flag-5	The current New Zealand flag is partially based on the United Kingdom's flag;
GUM_news_flag-6	the new one would be unique to New Zealand.
GUM_news_flag-7	The government's Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process, with the first meeting set to take place in Christchurch on May 16.
GUM_news_flag-8	According to the New Zealand Herald, Emeritus Professor John Burrows, the chairman of the project's panel of twelve, said New Zealand's flag has never before been open to public choice.
GUM_news_flag-9	Professor Burrows also said resources and kits would be accessible for schools and communities," For example, schools can run their own flag discussions and referendums to mirror the formal process as part of their own learning exercise".
GUM_news_flag-10	People were encouraged to submit their designs online at www.flag.govt.nz and suggest what the flag should mean on www.standfor.co.nz.
GUM_news_flag-11	Names of participants would be engraved, at their option, on a flag pole monument to be built in the nation's capital, Wellington.
GUM_news_flag-12	New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key said he believes redesigning the flag now has a "strong rationale".
GUM_news_flag-13	Mr Key promoted the campaign for a unique New Zealand flag on Waitangi Day - February 6 - this year.
GUM_news_flag-14	Of the public process, he said, "In the end I'll have one vote in each referendum just like every other New Zealander on the electoral roll".
GUM_news_flag-15	The New Zealand government intends to hold two referendums to reach a verdict on the flag, at an estimated cost of NZ $ 26 million, although a recent poll found only a quarter of citizens favoured changing the flag.
GUM_news_flag-16	This is a decrease from the year before, when it was forty percent.
GUM_news_flag-17	The first referendum is to be held from November 20 to December 11, selecting a single new flag design out of about four finalists.
GUM_news_flag-18	Voters would then choose between the new flag and their current flag early in 2016.
GUM_news_hackers-1	Hackers attack Church of Scientology website
GUM_news_hackers-2	Sunday, January 20, 2008
GUM_news_hackers-3	Wikinews has learned that according to an Internet posting made just over 24 hours ago, the Church of Scientology's website is being attacked by hackers, causing the site to shut down.
GUM_news_hackers-4	The attack was launched on Wednesday by a user labelled "Anonymous", on the website "Insurgency Wiki", a spinoff of 4chan.
GUM_news_hackers-5	The "History" section of the site explains, in a satirical fashion, that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube.
GUM_news_hackers-6	Though YouTube is complying with the Church of Scientology's requests to take down the video, other sites such as Gawker.com have stated that they will keep hosting the video.
GUM_news_hackers-7	"So far, it's the Internet: 1, Scientology: 0. But it's a long game." - Matthew Ingram
GUM_news_hackers-8	Writing in a blog post, Matthew Ingram of The Globe and Mail dubbed the ongoing conflict involving the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the Cruise video from the Internet: "Scientology vs. the Internet, part XVII".
GUM_news_hackers-9	He characterized the conflict between the Church of Scientology and anonymous posters of the Cruise video as "another small skirmish in a war that Scientology has been waging for almost 15 years, since the early days of newsgroups such as alt.religion.scientology, which posted internal church documents in 1994.
GUM_news_hackers-10	Lawsuits have been filed, mailing lists have been shut down, homes of discussion group participants have been raided and their computers seized -- an all-out war."
GUM_news_hackers-11	"Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video, a new obsession is taking hold on the internet. An insurgency against The Church of Scientology." Anonymous blogger, "Anon declares war on Church of Scientology"
GUM_news_hackers-12	One poster admitted to being a part of the effort, writing in a blog post "I have myself, as per instructions, loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage.
GUM_news_hackers-13	There s [sic] something in the hilarious anarchy of the net that produces these 'events' every now and again."
GUM_news_hackers-14	The poster wrote that "Prompted I think by the Tom Cruise video, a new obsession is taking hold on the internet.
GUM_news_hackers-15	An insurgency against The Church of Scientology."
GUM_news_hackers-16	"Someone emailed me earlier today talking about a tool a group’s been using to attack the scientology website.
GUM_news_hackers-17	It’s an interesting tool, created to overload/create malformed strings and crash a website’s database," said the post by an unknown author on pigmy.
GUM_news_hackers-18	The Church's website is currently unreachable.
GUM_news_hackers-19	Some individuals reported that when they are able to reach the site, all they get is a message stating, "The word scientology means search for truth ...".
GUM_news_hackers-20	As of 15:11 GMT the site was accessible again, but only loads at relatively slow speeds, and by the end of the day Saturday the site was not loading at all.
GUM_news_hackers-21	Posts on the message board for the Scientology-critic site Operation Clambake from Friday theorized that a denial-of-service attack had occurred, and wrote that as of Friday the Scientology.org site was either not loading at all, or loading very slowly.
GUM_news_hackers-22	Critics of Scientology at the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology were critical of the attacks to the Church of Scientology website, with one poster writing "How can people look at both sides if one side is gone?"
GUM_news_hackers-23	Traffic to the Scientology website had already increased 18-fold prior to the attack, following increased attention after the Tom Cruise video appeared on the Internet.
GUM_news_hackers-24	At that time, one in three visits to the site came from BBC News, and the website increased to number 3 in the company Hitwise UK's Lifestyle-Religion category.
GUM_news_ie9-1	Microsoft waits for death of Internet Explorer 6
GUM_news_ie9-2	Tuesday, March 8, 2011
GUM_news_ie9-3	With development of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) browser almost complete, Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for IE6 users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser.
GUM_news_ie9-4	Microsoft has replaced it with three newer versions.
GUM_news_ie9-5	On a new website, "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown", Microsoft has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE.
GUM_news_ie9-6	Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent.
GUM_news_ie9-7	"[Ten] years ago, a browser was born.
GUM_news_ie9-8	Its name was Internet Explorer 6.
GUM_news_ie9-9	Now that we ’re in 2011, in an era of modern web standards, it’s time to say goodbye," Microsoft says on "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown".
GUM_news_ie9-10	Internet Explorer's market share is slipping.
GUM_news_ie9-11	IE's various versions accounted for 70 percent of the market in 2009; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today.
GUM_news_ie9-12	Mozilla Firefox, its main rival, has been actively increasing its market share while the recently released Google Chrome is also quickly gaining users.
GUM_news_ie9-13	PC World's recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded, "Usually, Internet Explorer is the # 2 browser after Firefox, but over the past 30 days its been # 3, a couple of points behind Safari - and nearly tied with Chrome.
GUM_news_ie9-14	It might be a statistical blip.
GUM_news_ie9-15	But if it isn't, and Chrome continues to surge, IE could fall to fourth place. "
GUM_news_ie9-16	Web developers face big problems with IE6.
GUM_news_ie9-17	As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with advanced web technology and geared to the newest web core markup language HTML 5, they are forced to accommodate older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users.
GUM_news_ie9-18	Also, not mentioned on Microsoft's "The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown" site, are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser at risk of being hacked.
GUM_news_ie9-19	The Internet security firm Secunia.com, has said that as of March 4, 2011, IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities; 39 percent of these are rated "highly critical".
GUM_news_ie9-20	Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats.
GUM_news_ie9-21	Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it.
GUM_news_ie9-22	IE6 shipped with Windows XP, nearly a decade ago.
GUM_news_ie9-23	But it has outlived its usefulness, and Microsoft no longer wants to support it.
GUM_news_imprisoned-1	Australian woman claims Church of Scientology imprisoned her for twelve years
GUM_news_imprisoned-2	Thursday, May 7, 2015
GUM_news_imprisoned-3	Valeska Paris, an Australian woman and former Scientologist, has claimed that the Church of Scientology imprisoned her for twelve years aboard the Scientology - owned cruise ship, Freewinds.
GUM_news_imprisoned-4	The Church of Scientology's cruise ship Freewinds in Bonaire.
GUM_news_imprisoned-5	Paris was born in Switzerland but her parents moved her to the United Kingdom when she was six so they could be closer to the church's headquarters.
GUM_news_imprisoned-6	She joined the Sea Org aged 14.
GUM_news_imprisoned-7	In 1995, at age seventeen, she was told to disconnect from her mother.
GUM_news_imprisoned-8	Paris claims she was first sent to the ship aged eighteen for two weeks as a teenager but ended up spending twelve years there.
GUM_news_imprisoned-9	Paris also claims that her passport was taken away from her and she was forced to work in the engine room.
GUM_news_imprisoned-10	I was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive. Valeska Paris
GUM_news_imprisoned-11	I was basically hauled in and told that my mum had attacked the church and that I needed to disconnect from her because she was suppressive.
GUM_news_imprisoned-12	Her mother had spoken out against Scientology on French television after her ex-husband and Paris's father, Albert Jaquier, committed suicide after he lost his fortune to Scientology.
GUM_news_imprisoned-13	Paris claims that she was kept at Flag Land Base in Clearwater, Florida until she was eighteen and then transferred to the Freewinds.
GUM_news_imprisoned-14	On board the Freewinds, Paris claims that she was working from 6:00am to midnight and due to lack of sleep ended up being a walking zombie.
GUM_news_imprisoned-15	She also claims that in 1997 and 1998, she was tasked with removal of asbestos from the ship.
GUM_news_imprisoned-16	In 2007, Paris left the ship after a confrontation with the ship's management.
GUM_news_imprisoned-17	She was eventually sent to Rehabilitation Project Force in Sydney, which the Church describes as a religious retreat, but critics charge is a forced work camp.
GUM_news_imprisoned-18	Here, she met her future husband and subsequently left the church.
GUM_news_imprisoned-19	In a statement to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the Church denied these allegations:
GUM_news_imprisoned-20	She certainly wasn't 'forced' to be there.
GUM_news_imprisoned-21	She was also never forced to perform labour in the engine room.
GUM_news_imprisoned-22	They also claimed Paris was a volunteer and claim she has a vested interest for misrepresenting her experiences with the Church.
GUM_news_imprisoned-23	The Church also claims that Paris not having her passport was maritime procedure.
GUM_news_korea-1	North Korea puts military in 'quasi-state of war'
GUM_news_korea-2	Friday, August 21, 2015
GUM_news_korea-3	According to Yonhap news agency, quoting North Korea's main news agency Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the country's military has been placed on high alert and has been told to prepare a "quasi-state of war".
GUM_news_korea-4	The report comes after North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire yesterday.
GUM_news_korea-5	"War maniacs of the South Korean puppet military made another grave provocation to the DPRK in the central western sector of the front on Thursday afternoon.
GUM_news_korea-6	They perpetrated such reckless action as firing 36 shells at KPA civil police posts under the absurd pretext that the KPA fired one shell at the south side.
GUM_news_korea-7	Six shells of them hit the area near KPA civil police posts 542 and 543 and other 15 shells fell near KPA civil police posts 250 and 251", said KCNA.
GUM_news_korea-8	"Foolhardy provocation deserves harsh punishment", it added; and, later, "Kim Jong-un issued an order of the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA] that the front-line large combined units of the KPA should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations".
GUM_news_korea-9	Yesterday, North Korea fired artillery rounds aimed at a loudspeaker in South Korea that broadcasts anti-Pyongyang propaganda into the North.
GUM_news_korea-10	"Commanders of the Korean People's Army were hastily dispatched to the front-line troops to command military operations to destroy psychological warfare tools if the enemy does not stop the propaganda broadcast within 48 hours and prepare against the enemy's possible counteractions", added KCNA.
GUM_news_korea-11	No injuries or deaths were reported in the attacks from either side, but South Korea evacuated about 80 people in the town of Yeoncheon after at least one shell landed near the area.
GUM_news_korea-12	The South retaliated by firing dozens of rounds of artillery into the north.
GUM_news_korea-13	South Korea had recently started to broadcast propaganda from loudspeakers after an 11-year lull.
GUM_news_korea-14	The broadcasts began on August 10 and South Korea says the broadcasts will continue.
GUM_news_korea-15	After the exchange of fire, North Korea stated it would attack any loudspeakers broadcasting propaganda and would respond, militarily, within 48 hours if the broadcasts do not stop.
GUM_news_korea-16	Both countries have put their militaries on high levels of alert.

GUM_news_lanterns-3	Taipei, Taiwan — The Taipei City Lantern Festival was off to a bright start on Saturday Night as hundreds of thousands of people crowded onto the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial near downtown Taipei to witness city mayor Hau Lung-bin and other dignitaries ceremoniously flip the switch to light hundreds of colorful lantern scenes in and around the 240,000 square meter memorial park.
GUM_news_lanterns-4	The centerpiece of this rock concert-like performance is a 15 meter high rotating pig equipped with a fog machine, laser light show and theme music.
GUM_news_lanterns-5	The theme of this years lantern festival revolves around the 12 year Chinese zodiac cycles year of the pig.
GUM_news_lanterns-6	Its round shape symbolizes wealth and good fortune and is believed to bring good luck.
GUM_news_lanterns-7	Started in 1990, the Taipei lantern festival continues a 2000 year old tradition of light related festivals marking the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
GUM_news_lanterns-8	This particular event grows in popularity every year.
GUM_news_lanterns-9	Last Year over 4 million visitors attended the event and this year the city expects about 6 million visitors according to the event website.
GUM_news_lanterns-10	Colorful lantern scenes not only fill the central square but also the surrounding 2 km circumference of the memorial.
GUM_news_lanterns-11	Each section has a theme.
GUM_news_lanterns-12	One side of the memorial is scenes made by student groups while other areas represent the counties of Taiwan.
GUM_news_lanterns-13	There is even a section of lanterns sponsored by foreign countries.
GUM_news_lanterns-14	The Malaysia Tourism board was quite prominent at the main entrance to the grounds.
GUM_news_lanterns-15	As with all new year celebrations in Taiwan, the lantern festival is crowded.
GUM_news_lanterns-16	People flock to see the lantern scenes and enjoy the festival atmosphere as they carry lanterns, given away by the city and bought from street vendors at the event.
GUM_news_lanterns-17	The many light toys such a swords, devil ears, and lanterns turn the milling crowd into a unique light show that can be observed by climbing the steps of the 70 meter memorial hall on the grounds.
GUM_news_lanterns-18	Local public transportation hubs are often swamped by the event.
GUM_news_lanterns-19	The station staff at Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall Station do an excellent job of crowd control but lines for the subway can still be hours long and very exhausting.
GUM_news_lanterns-20	A sudden rain storm on Sunday night (March 4) caused a mass exodus of people to head for the station prompting lines that backed up into the street.
GUM_news_lanterns-21	The commuting crowds can be avoided however by walking from NTU Hospital Station or Shandao Station.
GUM_news_lanterns-22	Both of these stops are only about a 20 minute walk from the event and have no crowds at all.
GUM_news_lanterns-23	If you really want to avoid the crowds, definitely avoid the weekends.
GUM_news_lanterns-24	Wait until the fourth or fifth day of the festival when the crowds will have dwindled.
GUM_news_lanterns-25	I visited the festival on Saturday night, the opening night, and there was a sea of people in the square.
GUM_news_lanterns-26	I went back the next Tuesday night and there was almost no one there, just a few stray photographers taking advantage of the unimpeded views of the lanterns.
GUM_news_lanterns-27	The festival runs through March 11 this year.
GUM_news_stampede-1	Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede
GUM_news_stampede-2	Thursday, January 12, 2006
GUM_news_stampede-3	The Plains of Arafat on the day of Hajj
GUM_news_stampede-4	According to the Saudi Interior Ministry over 345 Muslim pilgrims have been killed in a stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage near Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
GUM_news_stampede-5	The stampede at Islam's most holy site happened at Jamarat Bridge, during an event where pebbles are thrown at a pillar to represent the stoning of Satan as part of the final rites of the Hajj.
GUM_news_stampede-6	The stampede began when luggage from a bus tripped pilgrims at the eastern end of the wall, causing a bottleneck.
GUM_news_stampede-7	Those who were tripped were then crushed by the wave of people behind them.
GUM_news_stampede-8	Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca during their lifetimes, if physically or financially possible, as it is one of the five pillars of the Islamic faith.
GUM_news_stampede-9	Saudi officials had already provided safeguards by installing an oval wall with padded edges to protect pilgrams from a crush, installed security cameras and placed over 60,000 security personnel in the area.
GUM_news_stampede-10	This is not the first time deadly stampedes have taken place during the Hajj, with the deadliest stampede during the 1991 Hajj, in which 1,426 pilgrims were trampled.
GUM_news_stampede-11	Last week, at least 76 people were killed when the Al-Ghaza Hotel near the Masjid Al-Haram (Grand Mosque) collasped, the cause of which is unknown.
GUM_news_taxes-1	Local municipalities in Italy ask taxes from religious schools
GUM_news_taxes-2	Sunday, August 2, 2015
GUM_news_taxes-3	In the past few days in Italy, several municipalities have started asking religious schools to pay taxes for property and local services, despite the resistance of the Catholic Church.
GUM_news_taxes-4	Instituto Gonzaga, a catholic school in Milan. Image: Friedrichstrasse.
GUM_news_taxes-5	The request of the municipalities results from the sentence of the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on July 8, recognising as legitimate the request of the Municipality of Livorno asking religious schools to pay property taxes.
GUM_news_taxes-6	Requests have come from the Municipality of Bogliasco, next to Genova, and from the deputies of Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) of the regional counsel of Lombardy.
GUM_news_taxes-7	The first case is of the mayor Luca Pastorino that in last years received several refusals of his requests for payment because of the religious nursery school and retirement home.
GUM_news_taxes-8	In the second case, the M5S party asks to the regional government to assure the local administrations of the region regularly apply the sentence of the Supreme Court.
GUM_news_taxes-9	The case on which the Court has ruled was of the religious schools Santo Spirito and Immacolata in Livorno, Tuscany, to pay over 422,000 euros in arrears for the period from 2004 to 2009.
GUM_news_taxes-10	The request was advanced by the Municipality of Livorno in 2010.
GUM_news_taxes-11	The city reasoned, "because the users of the private schools pay a frequency fee, this kind of activity is considered as a commercial one" ((it)).
GUM_news_taxes-12	In 2014 the Italian municipal tax discipline has changed from the ICI system to the IMU system by the Monti government.
GUM_news_taxes-13	A mean cost per student criterion is used to tax only the schools that receive a fee higher than the mean cost per student fixed by the State.
GUM_news_taxes-14	The new law is not retroactive, so the taxes requested in arrears from 2006 to 2009 are under the ICI system.
GUM_news_taxes-15	Minister of Education Stefania Giannini said a "more general reflection" ((it)) is needed.
GUM_news_taxes-16	Claudio De Vincenti, undersecretary to the prime minister, said "a discussion table will be opened with the non-profit associations, religious association included" ((it)).
GUM_news_taxes-17	Undersecretary for Education Mr. Toccafondi says "many schools will increase their fees or they will quit. Then the State will have to find new resources to build new structures and manage them" ((it)).
GUM_news_taxes-18	Also the president of the Lombardy region, Roberto Maroni, has reacted by proposing some regional counter-measures to finance private schools.
GUM_news_taxes-19	The secretary general of CEI (Italian Episcopal Conference), Nunzio Galantino, has called the sentence "dangerous" ((it)) and "ideological" ((it)):
GUM_news_taxes-20	"We face a dangerous sentence.
GUM_news_taxes-21	Who takes the decisions, do it with less ideology.
GUM_news_taxes-22	Because I have the clear sensation that with this way of thinking, they wait the praise of some ideologized supporters.
GUM_news_taxes-23	Indeed, they don't understand what kind of good service private schools held" ((it)).
GUM_news_taxes-24	Italian secularist associations are concerned the Government will modify the law in order to maintain an exception for religious schools.
GUM_news_taxes-25	The secularist magazine MicroMega describe the court's judgement as historic.
GUM_news_taxes-26	The Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics (UAAR) has launched a petition which now has more than 11,000 signatures, asking the government to respect and execute the sentence of the Supreme Court.
GUM_news_taxes-27	It is also encouraging citizens to ask for application of the law in their local municipalities.

GUM_news_warhol-7	Evansville, Indiana, United States -
GUM_news_warhol-8	This past week marked the opening night of an Andy Warhol exhibit at the University of Southern Indiana.
GUM_news_warhol-9	USI's art gallery, like 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country, is a recipient of a major Warhol donor program, and this program is cultivating new interest in Warhol's photographic legacy.
GUM_news_warhol-10	Wikinews reporters attended the opening and spoke to donors, exhibit organizers and patrons.
GUM_news_warhol-11	The USI art gallery celebrated the Thursday opening with its display of Warhol's Polaroids, gelatin silver prints and several colored screen prints.
GUM_news_warhol-12	USI's exhibit, which is located in Evansville, Indiana, is to run from January 23 through March 9.
GUM_news_warhol-13	Full interview with Kristin Wilkins, curator of the exhibition at the University of Southern Indiana.
GUM_news_warhol-14	Audio: Jkthom.
GUM_news_warhol-15	The McCutchan Art Center / Pace Galleries at USI bases its exhibit around roughly 100 Polaroids selected from its collection.
GUM_news_warhol-16	The Polaroids were all donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program, according to Kristen Wilkins, assistant professor of photography and curator of the exhibit.
GUM_news_warhol-17	The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts made two donations to USI Art Collections, in 2007 and a second recently.
GUM_news_warhol-18	Kathryn Waters, director of the gallery, expressed interest in further donations from the foundation in the future.
GUM_news_warhol-19	Since 2007 the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program has seeded university art galleries throughout the United States with over 28,000 Andy Warhol photographs and other artifacts.
GUM_news_warhol-20	The program takes a decentralized approach to Warhol's photography collection and encourages university art galleries to regularly disseminate and educate audiences about Warhol's artistic vision, especially in the area of photography.
GUM_news_warhol-21	University exhibits

GUM_news_warhol-24	Wikinews provides additional video, audio and photographs so our readers may learn more.
GUM_news_warhol-25	Wilkins observed that the 2007 starting date of the donation program, which is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, coincided with the 20th anniversary of Andy Warhol's death in 1987.
GUM_news_warhol-26	USI was not alone in receiving a donation.
GUM_news_warhol-27	K.C. Maurer, chief financial officer and treasurer at the Andy Warhol Foundation, said 500 institutions received the initial invitation and currently 190 universities have accepted one or more donations.
GUM_news_warhol-28	Institutional recipients, said Mauer, are required to exhibit their donated Warhol photographs every ten years as one stipulation.
GUM_news_warhol-29	While USI is holding its exhibit, there are also Warhol Polaroid exhibits at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York and an Edward Steichen and Andy Warhol exhibit at the Mary & Leigh Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
GUM_news_warhol-30	All have received Polaroids from the foundation.
GUM_news_warhol-31	University exhibits can reach out and attract large audiences.
GUM_news_warhol-32	For example, the Weatherspoon Art Museum at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro saw attendance levels reach 11,000 visitors when it exhibited its Warhol collection in 2010, according to curator Elaine Gustafon.
GUM_news_warhol-33	That exhibit was part of a collaboration combining the collections from Duke University, located in Durham, North Carolina, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which also were recipients of donated items from the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program.
GUM_news_warhol-34	Superstars
GUM_news_warhol-35	Each collection donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program holds Polaroids of well-known celebrities.
GUM_news_warhol-36	The successful UNC Greensboro exhibit included Polaroids of author Truman Capote and singer-songwriter Carly Simon.
GUM_news_warhol-37	"I think America's obsession with celebrity culture is as strong today as it was when Warhol was living", said Gustafon.
GUM_news_warhol-38	"People are still intrigued by how stars live, dress and socialize, since it is so different from most people's every day lives."
GUM_news_warhol-39	Wilkins explained Warhol's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life.
GUM_news_warhol-40	"He's hanging out with the celebrities, and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career", Wilkins said.
GUM_news_warhol-41	The exhibit at USI includes Polaroids of actor Dennis Hopper; musician Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran; publishers Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone Magazine and Carlo De Benedetti of Italy's la Repubblica; disco club owner Steve Rubell of Studio 54; photographers Nat Finkelstein, Christopher Makos and Felice Quinto; and athletes Vitas Gerulaitis (tennis) and Jack Nicklaus (golf).
GUM_news_warhol-42	Wikinews observed the USI exhibit identifies and features Polaroids of fashion designer Halston, a former resident of Evansville.
GUM_news_warhol-43	University collections across the United States also include Polaroids of "unknowns" who have not yet had their fifteen minutes of fame.
GUM_news_warming-1	Scientists analyse effects of global warming, atmospheric ozone on crops
GUM_news_warming-2	Monday, July 28, 2014
GUM_news_warming-3	A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Colorado State University of the US and the University of Sheffield of the UK has analysed effects of global warming and ozone pollution over 2000 - 2050 on the worldwide production of wheat, rice, maize and soybean.
GUM_news_warming-4	The study was published in journal Nature Climate Change yesterday.
GUM_news_warming-5	The scientists found reduction of crop yields by 2050 exceeded 10% of 2000 levels, substantially decreasing food security, in all cases examined.
GUM_news_warming-6	Several scenarios were considered because of uncertainty of future levels of ozone pollution.
GUM_news_warming-7	They estimated by 2050, increasing population and changing diet would increase world food needs by 50 percent.
GUM_news_warming-8	As coauthor Colette Heald told The Huffington Post, "The climate projections are quite consistent [...]
GUM_news_warming-9	the future of ozone pollution is very different [...] leading to either offsetting or reinforcing effects [of climate change] on crops".
GUM_news_warming-10	By 2050, undernourishment would increase by either 49 percent or by 27 percent, depending on the scenario.
GUM_news_warming-11	The study focuses on ozone-temperature covariation: ground-level ozone increases with temperatures.
GUM_news_warming-12	Heald said although temperature and ozone are separately known to impact crop yields, "nobody has looked at these together".
GUM_news_warming-13	Depending on region and crops, the yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone - in the case of wheat - or heat - in the case of maize - alone, providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation.
GUM_news_warming-14	The U.S. Department of Agriculture notes, "Ground-level ozone causes more damage to plants than all other air pollutants combined", highlighting the importance of air quality for agriculture.
GUM_news_warming-15	Results of NCLAN studies, published in a paper by AS Heagle in 1989, show dicot species, such as soybean, cotton, and peanut, lose more yield from ozone than do monocot species such as sorghum, field corn, and winter wheat.
GUM_news_warming-16	The researchers found that ozone pollution caused 46 percent of previously heat-attributed damage to soybean crops.
GUM_news_warming-17	The model does not include the effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration, which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply.
GUM_news_warming-18	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says some crops may have higher yields with increased levels of carbon dioxide.
GUM_news_warming-19	However, global warming also increases probability of extreme crops-damaging weather events such as floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures.
GUM_news_warming-20	Climate change affects distribution of weeds, pests, and diseases.
GUM_news_warming-21	Heald noted the findings show pollution reduction is also important.
GUM_news_warming-22	"An air-quality cleanup would improve crop yields [...]
GUM_news_warming-23	Ozone is something that we understand the causes of, and the steps that need to be taken to improve air quality."
GUM_news_warming-24	As Heald told The Huffington Post, US surface ozone has dropped partly due to the Clean Air Act.
GUM_news_warming-25	"Despite an increase in vehicle miles driven and energy consumption, surface ozone has declined by 25 percent on average across the U.S. from 1980 to 2012 [...]
GUM_news_warming-26	However, the future of ozone air quality in the U.S. and around the world will depend on local emissions, the use of pollution control technology, regulations, and air quality policy."
GUM_news_warming-27	The study was supported by the Croucher Foundation, US National Science Foundation, and US National Park Service.
GUM_news_worship-1	Greek court rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal
GUM_news_worship-2	Monday, March 27, 2006
GUM_news_worship-3	Greek court has ruled that worshippers of the ancient Greek religion may now formally associate and worship at archeological sites.
GUM_news_worship-4	Prior to the ruling, the religion was banned from conducting public worship at archeological sites by the Greek Ministry of Culture.
GUM_news_worship-5	Due to that, the religion was relatively secretive.
GUM_news_worship-6	The Greek Orthodox Church, a Christian denomination, is extremely critical of worshippers of the ancient deities.
GUM_news_worship-7	Today, about 100,000 Greeks worship the ancient gods, such as Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Aphrodite, and Athena.
GUM_news_worship-8	The Greek Orthodox Church estimates that number is closer to 40,000.
GUM_news_worship-9	Many neo-pagan religions, such as Wicca, use aspects of ancient Greek religions in their practice; Hellenic polytheism instead focuses exclusively on the ancient religions, as far as the fragmentary nature of the surviving source material allows.
GUM_voyage_chatham-1	The Chatham Islands
GUM_voyage_chatham-2	The Chatnam Islands (Rekohu in the indigenous Moriori language) are the eastern-most settled islands in New Zealand.
GUM_voyage_chatham-3	The islands are in their own time zone, 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time;
GUM_voyage_chatham-4	the International Date Line jogs eastward to keep them on the same calendar day as the rest of New Zealand.
GUM_voyage_chatham-5	The islands lie 860 km east of Christchurch, in the middle of the "Roaring Forties".
GUM_voyage_chatham-6	Steeped in culture and history, these islands are on the very edge of civilisation.
GUM_voyage_chatham-7	Experience Moriori culture, experience Rekohu.
GUM_voyage_chatham-8	Understand
GUM_voyage_chatham-9	The Chatham Islands consist of the main island, Chatham Island itself, with a population of 600, smaller Pitt Island with about 40 inhabitants, and a number of rocky outcrops.
GUM_voyage_chatham-10	The islands are volcanic in origin and have a unique and sensitive habitat that supports many rare and endangered species.
GUM_voyage_chatham-11	The original people of the islands are the Moriori, who were descended from the Maori of mainland New Zealand, but who developed their own culture and variant of the language.
GUM_voyage_chatham-12	In 1835 Maori settlers from the mainland arrived, massacred and enslaved the Moriori.
GUM_voyage_chatham-13	Get in
GUM_voyage_chatham-14	By plane
GUM_voyage_chatham-15	The only way for visitors to travel to the Chathams is via scheduled or chartered air service.
GUM_voyage_chatham-16	Air Chathams fly 5 days per week, from either Christchurch, Auckland or Wellington and, seasonally, from Napier.
GUM_voyage_chatham-17	The plane is based in the Chathams and flies to mainland New Zealand in the morning, then back to the Chathams in the afternoon.
GUM_voyage_chatham-18	As part of New Zealand, there are no passport or visa requirements and no border controls on arrival from the mainland.
GUM_voyage_chatham-19	You should book or ensure accommodation before you board a flight for the Chathams, as during the popular months of the tourism season, between October and April, accommodation can be severely limited.
GUM_voyage_chatham-20	There are no same-day return flights, so once there you have to stay at least one night.
GUM_voyage_chatham-21	Although flying to the Chathams and back is not cheap, it is worth it.
GUM_voyage_chatham-22	Even the mainland school groups that fly there for school camps, and choose to stay at Kopinga Marae [1] get value for money by chartering a flight one way.
GUM_voyage_chatham-23	Anyway, you don't have a choice on how you get there, unless you happen to own an aeroplane.
GUM_voyage_chatham-24	However, when you get off that aeroplane, if you haven't pre-organised transport, you will have to walk, and it is a long way into town.
GUM_voyage_chatham-25	By boat
GUM_voyage_chatham-26	The only scheduled shipping service to the Chatham Islands remains the Black Robin Freighters "Rangatira", an antiquated, slow and small coastal trading vessel.
GUM_voyage_chatham-27	This boat has serviced the islands for many years, but does not carry passengers.
GUM_voyage_chatham-28	Freight charges on the Rangatira appear to be flexible and subject to change.
GUM_voyage_chatham-29	Vessels can call at the Chathams and there are a number of "safe" harbours for shelter if the need arises.
GUM_voyage_chatham-30	Remember to notify the local policeman, or Ministry of Fisheries officer if you are entering New Zealand via the Chathams.
GUM_voyage_chatham-31	If you want a wharf berthage then call the local harbour master as you near the Chathams and he will sort you out.
GUM_voyage_chatham-32	Get around
GUM_voyage_chatham-33	There are several businesses on Chatham Island that will rent you a vehicle.
GUM_voyage_chatham-34	Do not expect the flashest and latest in rental cars though.
GUM_voyage_chatham-35	The cars "will" be warranted and safe, but they won't be exceptionally "flash".
GUM_voyage_chatham-36	Chatham Motors have a range of nice rental vans available as well and they provide pretty good service for both visitors and locals.

GUM_voyage_chatham-45	Hapupu National Historic Scenic Reserve.
GUM_voyage_chatham-46	One of only two National Historic Scenic Reserves in New Zealand (the other is the Waitangi Treaty Grounds), Hapupu is a special place, and somewhere that you will want to tell others about.
GUM_voyage_chatham-47	Spiritually and culturally important to Moriori, it holds the last known concentration of momori-rakau, or tree carvings done by the ancestors of today's Moriori.
GUM_voyage_chatham-48	There are many views on why they did these carvings, but whatever the reason, you will find them a very special attraction.
GUM_voyage_chatham-49	Port Hutt.
GUM_voyage_chatham-50	One of the most scenicly attractive ports in the whole of New Zealand, Port Hutt boasts an incredibly sheltered little harbour, with picturesque views and safe anchorage in all weather.
GUM_voyage_chatham-51	Historically important and economically crucial for these islands today, Port Hutt is the ideal location for a short browse around and a mecca for those photography buffs [2].
GUM_voyage_chatham-52	Kopinga Marae.
GUM_voyage_chatham-53	If you could define a place that will remind you of your visit to the Chathams, then this very special place will be at the top of your list.
GUM_voyage_chatham-54	Opened in 2005, Kopinga is the official meeting place of Te Imi Moriori.
GUM_voyage_chatham-55	Adorned with contemporary Moriori carvings and traditional taonga (treasures), the marae is a magnificent, tasteful and contemporary testament to the ancestors of Te Imi Moriori.

GUM_voyage_cleveland-1	Cleveland is a culturally diverse city on the shores of Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, USA.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-2	Recreational, cultural and educational opportunities are abundant throughout Northeast Ohio.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-3	Youll find world-class museums and cultural events, professional sports and amusement parks, and the most golf courses per capita in the United States.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-4	Places Rated Almanac ranks the area second in recreational options out of 354 US metro areas.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-5	Plus, this region ranks fifth in the nation in number of major cultural resources per one million residents.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-6	Understand
GUM_voyage_cleveland-7	Cleveland from lakefront.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-8	Cleveland is the urban center of Northeast Ohio, the 15th largest combined metropolitan area in the United States.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-9	Throughout the twentieth century, the City of Cleveland proper was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. (from 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics).
GUM_voyage_cleveland-10	Like most U.S. cities, Cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-11	However, in the mid-1980s, Cleveland earned the nickname the "Comeback City" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-12	As its "comeback" has continued, the official moniker is now the New American City as Cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-13	Despite the common perception that Cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on the southern shore of Lake Erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you can't see the other side, i.e., Canada).
GUM_voyage_cleveland-14	Like other cities in the so-called "rust belt“, Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-15	While Cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the U.S. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services.
GUM_voyage_cleveland-16	Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum

GUM_voyage_lodz-1	Łódź
GUM_voyage_lodz-2	Łódź (Pronounced: Wootch) is Poland's third biggest city, and the capital of the Łódzkie Voivodship.
GUM_voyage_lodz-3	Unlike most other large Polish cities, which have long histories, Łódź was created almost from scratch during the 19th century textile industry boom to house textile mills, their owners and their workers, and rapidly grew to become an important industrial and commerce centre.
GUM_voyage_lodz-4	In recent years, Łódź has been battling rising unemployment and youth migration resulting from the failing textile industry and is repositioning itself as a hub for design and creative industries.
GUM_voyage_lodz-5	Owing to its history, Łódź has an impressive collection of residential, commercial and industrial 19th-century architecture including some of Europe's largest factory buildings, now mostly repurposed as shopping centres or lofts.
GUM_voyage_lodz-6	Recent local investment and a long-standing cultural scene ensures there is always something more to do than just sightseeing or shopping, with the city hosting some of the best museums and art galleries in the country.
GUM_voyage_lodz-7	The close proximity of Warsaw and Łódź's location at the crossroads of the Polish motorway system make it an ideal destination for a day trip or longer city break.
GUM_voyage_lodz-8	Understand
GUM_voyage_lodz-9	Historic fire station in Księży Młyn area
GUM_voyage_lodz-10	Name and history
GUM_voyage_lodz-11	The origin of the city's name is unknown, however, the word łódź translates to "boat" in English.
GUM_voyage_lodz-12	This is referred to in the emblem and when you hear the dwellers of Łódź (łodzianin (man) łodzianka (woman) łodzianie (plural)) calling themselves "the boat people".
GUM_voyage_lodz-13	A settlement on the area of present-day Łódź was established in the 14th century and in 1423 it was granted a town charter, along with the right to have a marketplace.
GUM_voyage_lodz-14	However, the real development of Łódź started with the industrial era at the beginning of the 19th century when the city was chosen to be the heart of the rapidly-growing textile industry.
GUM_voyage_lodz-15	The population of Łódź soared from some 4,000 people in the 1830s and 40,000 in 1865 to over 300,000 inhabitants at the turn of the century, which was an unprecedented growth on a worldwide scale.
GUM_voyage_lodz-16	The rapid development of Łódź in the second half of the 19th century was brought about by the rise of enormous industrialist fortunes.
GUM_voyage_lodz-17	New inhabitants, craftsmen and merchants came to Łódź; markets and town fairs came to life.
GUM_voyage_lodz-18	The profits obtained from prosperous textile mills opened up practically unlimited possibilities for their owners.
GUM_voyage_lodz-19	The city residences became expressions of the riches and power of the local tycoons.
GUM_voyage_lodz-20	They were usually situated next to the owner's factory.
GUM_voyage_lodz-21	Ever since the industrial revolution brought a massive influx of workforce, Łódź had been a city almost equally divided between four cultures - Polish, Jewish, German and Russian.
GUM_voyage_lodz-22	The day before the outbreak of World War II, Łódź was inhabited by approximately 672,000 people, among whom 35% were of Jewish faith and some 15% were ethnic German.
GUM_voyage_lodz-23	Andrzej Wajda's movie, Promised Land based on a novel by the Nobel laureate Władysław Reymont, depicts those times and is a worthwhile introduction to the city's bustling history.
GUM_voyage_lodz-24	During the Nazi occupation, Łódź was incorporated directly into the Third Reich.
GUM_voyage_lodz-25	The city was renamed to Litzmannstadt, and Piotrkowska Street was called Adolf-Hitler-Strasse.
GUM_voyage_lodz-26	The Jewish community was practically wiped out, and many others lost their lives.
GUM_voyage_lodz-27	Although the city was not destroyed in the aftermath, the material losses were serious as the machinery, raw materials and finished goods were taken away by the fleeing Nazis.
GUM_voyage_lodz-28	The day before the liberation, about 80,000 Germans left Łódź in panic.
GUM_voyage_lodz-29	At the beginning of 1945, the population was estimated at 300,000.
GUM_voyage_lodz-30	Plac Wolności
GUM_voyage_lodz-31	Łódź today
GUM_voyage_lodz-32	Since the fall of communism in Poland, Łódź has not enjoyed the rapid economic growth cities like Kraków, Warsaw and Wrocław have experienced, and has had to endure the fall of much of its textile industry, rising unemployment and emigration (within Poland and abroad).
GUM_voyage_lodz-33	This led to further dilapidation of the investment-starved city, and many of its streets and buildings show profound signs of neglect.
GUM_voyage_lodz-34	At first glance, for a city of 760,000 and agglomeration of 1.428,000, there does not seem to be much to see.
GUM_voyage_lodz-35	However, the situation is rapidly changing now with Łódź campaigning and redesigning itself as an up-and-coming destination.
GUM_voyage_lodz-36	To accomplish this, Łódź has been capitalizing on its film history - Łódź is jokingly referred to as the "HollyŁódź" of Poland and hosts several film festivals and many other cultural events.
GUM_voyage_lodz-37	Łódź today may not have the glitz and glamour of its heyday; however, there is a certain charm to Łódź in its partially renovated façades and leitmotivs, not to mention its grand artistic traditions.

GUM_voyage_phoenix-7	Phoenix is extremely hot and dry in the summertime, so always have sunscreen with you!
GUM_voyage_phoenix-8	Understand
GUM_voyage_phoenix-9	Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert?
GUM_voyage_phoenix-10	The answer is, surprisingly, agriculture.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-11	The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-12	The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-13	White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-14	The city's name reflects its history as a city "reborn from the ashes" of the previous settlement.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-15	European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-16	Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-17	Recent years are seeing a revival, and trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-18	Warm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry, and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-19	High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II, and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-20	As a result, a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2014 estimate of 1,537,058 (with the metro area estimated at 4,489,109).
GUM_voyage_phoenix-21	Climate
GUM_voyage_phoenix-22	Phoenix has an arid climate with long, hot summers and very mild winters.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-23	It has the highest average temperature of any metropolitan area in the States.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-24	The weather varies enormously from one season to the next.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-25	While it's not as cold as in the northern states during the winter, it does freeze sometimes, and temperatures in the 30s ° F (that's around or slightly above 0 ° C) are not unheard of.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-26	In the summer, very hot and dry heat is the norm.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-27	On the hottest days, it can get up to 115 ° F (46 ° C) or more.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-28	Monsoon rains with lightning occur regularly from July to September during the late afternoon and evening, occasionally overnight also.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-29	April is the most ideal month.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-30	In some neighborhoods, cicada insects make loud sounds from sunset to sunrise.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-31	Talk
GUM_voyage_phoenix-32	English is the dominant language in Phoenix.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-33	However, like much of the Southwest with a large Hispanic population, Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix.
GUM_voyage_phoenix-34	Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places, although English is the language of preference, especially when dealing with businesses and government.

GUM_voyage_tulsa-5	The Tulsa Bartlesville Combined area had 988,000 in the 2010 census.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-6	Understand
GUM_voyage_tulsa-7	Tulsa lies in northeastern Oklahoma, at the convergence of the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau, and receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year, both of which account for its abundant beautiful rolling green terrain.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-8	As a result, Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat, arid dust bowl.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-9	Summers can be very warm and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter, but it does not last long.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-10	The winters are considered to be very mild.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-11	There is not much snow, just a few inches each year, typically, although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large "ice storms".
GUM_voyage_tulsa-12	Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-13	In Tulsa you will find old west charm as well as a cosmopolitan atmosphere.

GUM_voyage_tulsa-40	Thanks to urban planning, the major city streets are placed in a grid layout.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-41	Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other, and exactly in a straight line.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-42	That makes it much easier to find places than in cities where streets go every which way.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-43	The major exception is downtown, which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-44	By car
GUM_voyage_tulsa-45	Several freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area: I-244, I-44, US 169 (Mingo Valley Expressway, aka "Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway"), US 75, Hwy 51 (Broken Arrow Expressway, The "B.A."), Creek Turnpike.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-46	The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system, with the main arterials running on each mile.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-47	In the core of the city, named avenues run north / south and are named after US cities, generally in repeating alphabetical order (for example, Winston - Yale - Allegheny - Braden).
GUM_voyage_tulsa-48	In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-49	North / South is divided by Admiral Blvd.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-50	Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River, vice versa for name streets west of Main.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-51	In the parts of the city farther from downtown, north-south streets are numbered.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-52	It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is North / South 145th East / West Avenue.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-53	Numbered streets run East / West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-54	Watch out for Place, Street, Avenue designation, e.g. 47th Place, 47th Street, or Florence Place, Florence Avenue.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-55	It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is West / East 71st Street North / South.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-56	In some parts of the city, numbered streets intersect, so the distinction is important.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-57	Although rare, one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-58	Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-59	When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat, the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-60	Thus the "twisted" area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-61	By bus
GUM_voyage_tulsa-62	Tulsa Transit provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-63	Cities served are Tulsa, Sand Springs, Sapulpa, Jenks, and Broken Arrow.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-64	The central station is at 319 S. Denver (downtown).
GUM_voyage_tulsa-65	They do not run that often, especially to the outer towns like Broken Arrow.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-66	Unlike major cities in the Northeast, the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-67	It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-68	By bicycle
GUM_voyage_tulsa-69	Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-70	Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-71	The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-72	The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-73	The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-74	Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa's rolling land to be a bit more challenging, particularly during the heat of summer.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-75	If you are looking for a good workout, the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land's original contours.
GUM_voyage_tulsa-76	Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route.

GUM_voyage_york-1	York
GUM_voyage_york-2	York is an ancient cathedral city with a history that dates back to before Roman times.
GUM_voyage_york-3	It is situated in Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, England with some of the best preserved historical buildings and structures in Europe.
GUM_voyage_york-4	As of the 2001 census, the population of York was 181,000.
GUM_voyage_york-5	York is frequently ranked (often vying with Manchester) the second most visited city in England after London.
GUM_voyage_york-6	York Minster
GUM_voyage_york-7	Understand
GUM_voyage_york-8	York was known as Eboracum by the Romans, who founded the fortress city on the River Ouse in the year 71.
GUM_voyage_york-9	York was home first to the Ninth Legion and later the Sixth.
GUM_voyage_york-10	York quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain, and after 211 became the capital of the province Britannia Inferior.
GUM_voyage_york-11	Constantine the Great - later responsible for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire - was first proclaimed Emperor in the city.
GUM_voyage_york-12	Captured by the Vikings 866, the city quickly took on a new identity as Jorvik (pronounced "Yor-vik") and experienced a major urban revival as a centre of Viking trade and settlement in northern England.
GUM_voyage_york-13	The Coppergate excavations of the 1970s revealed much of this Viking past.
GUM_voyage_york-14	York is a fairly small city - four days is enough to see the major sights although York is a city that reveals its charms to explorers with curiosity and patience.
GUM_voyage_york-15	York is known as England's "City of Festivals "as there are regular cultural festivals every year.
GUM_voyage_york-16	The official festivals are the Viking Festival, the Festival of Angels, Early Music, Late Music, Horse Racing (the "Ebor Race Meeting"), Multicultural Food and Arts, Chinese New Year, Mystery Plays, Christmas St Nicholas' Fair, and the Food and Drink Festival.
GUM_voyage_york-17	It's a romantic city for a weekend break.
GUM_voyage_york-18	York is full of magic and a wonderful place to bring children!
GUM_voyage_york-19	Get in
GUM_voyage_york-20	Most travellers will arrive in York by road (car or bus) or rail from other parts of the UK or an airport.
GUM_voyage_york-21	By car
GUM_voyage_york-22	Although York is not directly on any of the main north-south motorways, the connections are reasonably good.
GUM_voyage_york-23	From the south, the quickest route is probably to take the M1 northbound to junction 32, then the M18 eastbound to junction 2, the A1M northbound to junction 44 and finally the A64 eastbound to the York Outer Ring Road (A1237).
GUM_voyage_york-24	Alternatively, you can take the M1 all the way to the A64, but the upper reaches of the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds can get very congested, especially in the rush hours.
GUM_voyage_york-25	From the west, the A59 and the M62 provide connections from Liverpool and Manchester, and from the north the A1 and the A19 link York with Tyneside, Northumberland and south-eastern Scotland.
GUM_voyage_york-26	Driving into the city centre itself is something to avoid.
GUM_voyage_york-27	Traffic congestion on the main arterial roads serving the city (especially the A19 on Bootham and the Inner Ring Road) can get very bad, especially during the rush hours and on Saturday mornings.
GUM_voyage_york-28	The remodelling of some roads near bottleneck junctions to accommodate bicycle lanes has made traffic jams even worse still in recent years, and parking in the city centre is very expensive.
GUM_voyage_york-29	If you are just visiting York for the day, using a Park and Ride [1] costs a lot less than trying to park in or near the city centre, and there are five sites dotted around the Outer Ring Road.
GUM_voyage_york-30	However, the last buses from the city centre leave at around 8 pm in the evenings and you are not allowed to leave your car in a Park and Ride overnight.
GUM_voyage_york-31	Therefore, if you are staying overnight in York and arriving by car, make sure that your hotel offers parking before you book.
GUM_voyage_york-32	If you are only visiting for the day but staying until late evening, you will need to use a city centre car park.
GUM_whow_arrogant-1	How to Detect Arrogant People
GUM_whow_arrogant-2	Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves, intolerant of people different from them, rude or downright arrogant?
GUM_whow_arrogant-3	These people can be a great source of potential pain, and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant.
GUM_whow_arrogant-4	Steps
GUM_whow_arrogant-5	Pay attention to their conversations.
GUM_whow_arrogant-6	Don't eavesdrop, but when they 're talking to you or to those around you, listen to them.
GUM_whow_arrogant-7	Is it always about them?
GUM_whow_arrogant-8	Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else?
GUM_whow_arrogant-9	These are good signs of arrogance.
GUM_whow_arrogant-10	Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience, and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience "have got something over them".
GUM_whow_arrogant-11	Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning (actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability), arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited, narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others.
GUM_whow_arrogant-12	Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you don't.
GUM_whow_arrogant-13	Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good.
GUM_whow_arrogant-14	When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you.
GUM_whow_arrogant-15	This happens when you question (or at least seem to question) their appearance, intelligence, athletic abilities, or anything else relating to their self-image.
GUM_whow_arrogant-16	Challenge their worldview.
GUM_whow_arrogant-17	Don't be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious.
GUM_whow_arrogant-18	If they get upset, gauge their anger.
GUM_whow_arrogant-19	If it's minimal, they may be simply having a bad day.
GUM_whow_arrogant-20	But if they 're enraged, then they may see you as questioning their 'perfect little world.'
GUM_whow_arrogant-21	And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance.
GUM_whow_arrogant-22	At some point or another, most people realize that the world doesn't revolve around them.
GUM_whow_arrogant-23	Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them, and get angry if they 're reminded of the real world.
GUM_whow_arrogant-24	Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection, change and lack of certainty (realities we all must contend with as best we can).
GUM_whow_arrogant-25	As such, instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one's preferences, the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone, which of course, is an impossible mission.
GUM_whow_arrogant-26	Reality hurts when it intrudes; as such, an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse, thereby not seeing their own imperfections.
GUM_whow_arrogant-27	They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances.
GUM_whow_arrogant-28	Learn the quality of their friendships.
GUM_whow_arrogant-29	Don't be nosy or gossipy, but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next, that's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends.
GUM_whow_arrogant-30	That's a sign of arrogance, since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who's stuck on themselves.
GUM_whow_arrogant-31	Prideful people have a strong need to look good, and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that.
GUM_whow_arrogant-32	Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them, they often can't stand the thought of a good friendship.
GUM_whow_arrogant-33	Ironically, arrogant people often can't understand why they don't have any reliable and supportive friends.
GUM_whow_arrogant-34	How do they treat those not like themselves?
GUM_whow_arrogant-35	In other words, how do they treat those with different beliefs, cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world?
GUM_whow_arrogant-36	If it's inherently negative, then they 're either over-zealous, ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only.
GUM_whow_arrogant-37	Determine this based on their general personality and the people they 're interacting with.
GUM_whow_arrogant-38	Many times prideful people have a serious 'my-way's-the-only-way' attitude.
GUM_whow_arrogant-39	This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land.
GUM_whow_arrogant-40	What's their personality like?
GUM_whow_arrogant-41	Take note of how they act, talk, and use their social status.
GUM_whow_arrogant-42	Do they have a general sense of 'coolness?'
GUM_whow_arrogant-43	Are they a chatterbox?
GUM_whow_arrogant-44	Do they act like they own the place, or act like the 'big dog?'
GUM_whow_arrogant-45	Are they very keen on their self-image?
GUM_whow_arrogant-46	Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through.
GUM_whow_arrogant-47	But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they don't like.
GUM_whow_arrogant-48	When they are cruel, their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they 're afraid that they'll be treated badly by their 'friend.'
GUM_whow_arrogant-49	Mention people you know that they don't like.
GUM_whow_arrogant-50	This isn't meant to begin a conflict, but to gauge their rivalries, annoyances and enmities.
GUM_whow_arrogant-51	If their condemnation seems to be reasonable, they probably aren't hubristic.
GUM_whow_arrogant-52	If it's harsh, they are.
GUM_whow_arrogant-53	For the most part, arrogant people see people that they don't like as threats to their perfect little world.
GUM_whow_arrogant-54	The more they hate someone, the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land.
GUM_whow_arrogant-55	And in turn, the bigger the threat, the harsher the criticism.
GUM_whow_arrogant-56	Ask around to see what they've been saying about you.
GUM_whow_arrogant-57	If they have been saying bad things about you, they may simply not like you.
GUM_whow_arrogant-58	If they 're nice to your face, but talk bad about you behind your back like it's their favourite hobby, then they probably have a problem with pride.
GUM_whow_arrogant-59	Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they don't have any good friends.
GUM_whow_arrogant-60	They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a 'quantity, not quality' mentality.
GUM_whow_arrogant-61	Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they aren't looking.
GUM_whow_ballet-1	How to Ballet Dance
GUM_whow_ballet-2	Ballet began in royal courts in the early 1600's, and early forms of this elegant and sophisticated art involved long skirts and wooden clogs.
GUM_whow_ballet-3	Dancing ballet is extremely popular throughout the world, and studying ballet can help develop strong bodies, spatial and temporal awareness, and improve coordination.
GUM_whow_ballet-4	People who study ballet also retain flexibility throughout their adult lives, making this technique the basis of training for all types of dance.
GUM_whow_ballet-5	While dancing ballet takes dedication and requires serious training, you can learn the basics to prepare yourself for further study.
GUM_whow_ballet-6	Learn to get ready for practicing, the basic positions, and some of the first techniques you 're likely to encounter in ballet.
GUM_whow_ballet-7	Part 1 Getting Ready to Dance
GUM_whow_ballet-8	Stretch your muscles thoroughly.
GUM_whow_ballet-9	Stretching is important to loosen muscles, strengthen muscles and to elongate your posture.
GUM_whow_ballet-10	It is vital that it is done at the beginning of each ballet session, including before a performance.
GUM_whow_ballet-11	When taking on ballet, it is important to stretch daily for at least 15 - 30 minutes, to give the muscles ample opportunity to warm up, reducing the risk of injury.
GUM_whow_ballet-12	You should also stretch to "wind down" at the end of ballet dancing.
GUM_whow_ballet-13	Always wear ballet slippers.
GUM_whow_ballet-14	Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug, but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet.
GUM_whow_ballet-15	There are different styles and types of shoes, so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice, given your intentions for dancing.
GUM_whow_ballet-16	Don't buy shoes to grow into, because your feet will seem flexed when you pointe and will look flat.
GUM_whow_ballet-17	You should fit them to where the drawstring is tied slightly loose.
GUM_whow_ballet-18	If your drawstring is longer than your pinkie then you should cut it off till it is roughly the size of your fingernail.
GUM_whow_ballet-19	The drawstring just completes the fit.
GUM_whow_ballet-20	It isn't made to tighten overly large shoes.
GUM_whow_ballet-21	If you can't buy ballet shoes, that it is okay.
GUM_whow_ballet-22	Use socks without the stickies on the bottom, so you can turn!
GUM_whow_ballet-23	Wear comfortable and snug-fitting athletic clothes.
GUM_whow_ballet-24	The most important thing is that you are comfortable, and that you 're not wearing baggy or loose fitting clothing so you can make sure you 're forming and moving correctly in the mirror.
GUM_whow_ballet-25	A plain black leotard and pink tights are usually a safe bet.
GUM_whow_ballet-26	Pink or black ballet slippers are also appropriate.
GUM_whow_ballet-27	If you 're signed up for a class, check with your instructor to find out if there is a dress code at the school.
GUM_whow_ballet-28	Some schools may have students wear the same thing and others may just require any type of leotard and tights and sometimes ballet skirts.
GUM_whow_ballet-29	Mostly they require tight fitting clothing so they can see that your muscles are working properly and so on.
GUM_whow_ballet-30	Find an appropriate space to practice.
GUM_whow_ballet-31	Ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them.
GUM_whow_ballet-32	The moves themselves are relatively straightforward, but the positing, the timing, and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice.
GUM_whow_ballet-33	For this reason, it's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor, who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you 're dancing properly.
GUM_whow_ballet-34	A dancing studio is equipped with mirrors for correcting your positioning and seeing what you 're doing accurately, and a barre for practicing. [1]
GUM_whow_ballet-35	If you want to practice at home, make sure you've got enough open space to move freely, preferably on a hard wood floor.
GUM_whow_ballet-36	The back of a chair can replace the need for a bar.
GUM_whow_ballet-37	Position a large mirror so you can check your positioning and see what you 're doing.
GUM_whow_basil-1	How to Grow Basil
GUM_whow_basil-2	Three Methods: Starting Seeds Caring for Basil Harvesting and Using Basil
GUM_whow_basil-3	Basil is easy to grow, and transforms ordinary meals into culinary treasures!
GUM_whow_basil-4	Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried, it actually tastes different, almost as if it were not the same herb.
GUM_whow_basil-5	This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil.
GUM_whow_basil-6	Method 1 of 3: Starting Seeds
GUM_whow_basil-7	1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow.
GUM_whow_basil-8	Basil comes in many different varieties, each of which have a unique flavor and smell.
GUM_whow_basil-9	Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you, then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store.
GUM_whow_basil-10	Here are a few ideas:
GUM_whow_basil-11	Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice, and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers.
GUM_whow_basil-12	Lemon basil actually contains citral, an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit, and smells very lemony.
GUM_whow_basil-13	Purple basil is often grown for decoration, as well as its scent and flowers.
GUM_whow_basil-14	There are perennial basils which come back year after year, like African Blue Basil (which has pretty blue veins on its leaves) and Thai Basil, while most other varieties are annuals, which you'll have to plant year after year.
GUM_whow_basil-15	Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow, but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained.
GUM_whow_basil-16	2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost.
GUM_whow_basil-17	Basil needs warm air and sun to do well, so it's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they'll get damaged by frost.
GUM_whow_basil-18	If you live in a hot climate, you can start the seeds outside instead.
GUM_whow_basil-19	To figure out when the last frost will be, consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area.
GUM_whow_basil-20	3 Prepare seed containers.
GUM_whow_basil-21	Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat.
GUM_whow_basil-22	Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets.
GUM_whow_basil-23	Dampen the mixture with water so it's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate.
GUM_whow_basil-24	4 Plant the seeds.
GUM_whow_basil-25	Drop one to two seeds into each container.
GUM_whow_basil-26	Cover them lightly with soil.
GUM_whow_basil-27	Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap, so they stay moist.
GUM_whow_basil-28	Leave the containers in a sunny window.
GUM_whow_basil-29	Twice daily, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water.
GUM_whow_basil-30	5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge.
GUM_whow_basil-31	When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil, it's time to remove the plastic wrap.
GUM_whow_basil-32	Keep watering the sprouts twice daily, never letting the soil dry out.
GUM_whow_basil-33	When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature, it's time to transplant them to a larger container.
GUM_whow_basil-34	Method 2 of 3: Caring for Basil
GUM_whow_basil-35	1 Transplant the basil plants.
GUM_whow_basil-36	Once two sets of leaves have formed, basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers.
GUM_whow_basil-37	Basil does not tolerate frost so don't plant too early.
GUM_whow_basil-38	It's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil.
GUM_whow_basil-39	To plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart.
GUM_whow_basil-40	Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems.
GUM_whow_basil-41	Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets.
GUM_whow_basil-42	If you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you 're growing;
GUM_whow_basil-43	they need to be planted 6 inches apart, since they grow quite large.
GUM_whow_basil-44	2 Keep the soil damp, but not soaked.
GUM_whow_basil-45	Basil does best in well-drained soil, and should not be subjected to standing water.
GUM_whow_basil-46	Water the mature basil plants once a day, in the morning, so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight.
GUM_whow_basil-47	3 Pinch off flower heads.
GUM_whow_basil-48	When you see flower buds, pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off.
GUM_whow_basil-49	Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves, as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows.
GUM_whow_basil-50	This is called" bolting" and is more likely to happen when there's extra sunshine.
GUM_whow_basil-51	You'll notice that if you leave the flowers, the plant will become lanky and the leaves won't be as full or tasty.
GUM_whow_basil-52	4 Watch for pests and mold.
GUM_whow_basil-53	Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles
GUM_whow_basil-54	the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand.
GUM_whow_basil-55	If your plants show signs of mold growth, they may not be getting adequate sunlight, or they may be too close together.
GUM_whow_basil-56	Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space.
GUM_whow_basil-57	Method 3 of 3: Harvesting and Using Basil
GUM_whow_basil-58	1 Harvest and prune.
GUM_whow_basil-59	As the plant matures, pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height.
GUM_whow_basil-60	If you look closely, at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off.
GUM_whow_basil-61	Cut close to those tiny leaves, but be sure not to damage them.
GUM_whow_basil-62	Pinching encourages the plant's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves.
GUM_whow_basil-63	This helps the plants grow bushy.
GUM_whow_basil-64	Don't pinch on the lower part of the stem, or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy.
GUM_whow_basil-65	You want them to get bushy, so pinch from the top.
GUM_whow_basil-66	2 Enjoy the basil fresh.
GUM_whow_basil-67	Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese.
GUM_whow_basil-68	3 Store the basil in the refrigerator.
GUM_whow_basil-69	You'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh, so plan on storing some in the fridge.
GUM_whow_basil-70	Wash the leaves, dry them well, and wrap them in paper towels.
GUM_whow_basil-71	Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid.
GUM_whow_basil-72	4 Freeze the basil.
GUM_whow_basil-73	Freezing the leaves whole doesn't work very well, but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months.
GUM_whow_basil-74	Place the basil in a blender with a little water.
GUM_whow_basil-75	Puree it until smooth, then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it.
GUM_whow_chicken-1	How to Hypnotize a Chicken
GUM_whow_chicken-2	Anyone who's spent a lot of time on a farm with chickens is probably familiar with this trick.
GUM_whow_chicken-3	Those who've never heard of this will be amazed to see a chicken lie perfectly still after these instructions are followed.
GUM_whow_chicken-4	Biologists think that fear causes this "hypnosis," which may be an attempt to "play dead" to fool predators.
GUM_whow_chicken-5	Method One of Two: Hypnotizing a Chicken
GUM_whow_chicken-6	Hold the chicken down on a flat surface.
GUM_whow_chicken-7	Hold the chicken with one hand supporting the breast.
GUM_whow_chicken-8	Place it down so that its breast is carrying its weight and rests on the ground.
GUM_whow_chicken-9	Continue to hold its feet so the grand experiment can continue.
GUM_whow_chicken-10	You can place the chicken on its breast instead.
GUM_whow_chicken-11	Press gently down on its back, and gently move its legs back if it tries to stand up.
GUM_whow_chicken-12	Wiggle your finger.
GUM_whow_chicken-13	Hold the bird down gently with one hand.
GUM_whow_chicken-14	Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip, without touching it.
GUM_whow_chicken-15	Move the finger backward to about 4 inches (10 cm) away, then back again.
GUM_whow_chicken-16	Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking.
GUM_whow_chicken-17	Let go of its legs.
GUM_whow_chicken-18	The chicken should be "hypnotized" and cease to struggle.
GUM_whow_chicken-19	It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes.
GUM_whow_chicken-20	Draw a line in front of its beak instead.
GUM_whow_chicken-21	If the chicken wasn't hypnotized, try this alternative.
GUM_whow_chicken-22	Using chalk, a stick, or your finger, draw a line on the ground 12 " (30 cm) long.
GUM_whow_chicken-23	Start near the chicken's beak and draw the line slowly outward, in front of its head.
GUM_whow_chicken-24	Wake it up by clapping.
GUM_whow_chicken-25	Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business.
GUM_whow_chicken-26	Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away.
GUM_whow_chicken-27	Method Two of Two: Reducing Stress in the Chicken
GUM_whow_chicken-28	Understand the hypnotic effect.
GUM_whow_chicken-29	Researchers call this effect "tonic immobility".
GUM_whow_chicken-30	"When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened, its heart rate lowers and it stops moving.
GUM_whow_chicken-31	This may be an attempt to play dead, discouraging predators that prefer live prey.
GUM_whow_chicken-32	Unlike an opossum, the chicken gives an unconvincing act, as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way."
GUM_whow_chicken-33	Keep the chicken upright or on its side.
GUM_whow_chicken-34	While it's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet, this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken's hip.
GUM_whow_chicken-35	Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may "succeed" by cutting off its air supply.
GUM_whow_chicken-36	This can cause the chicken significant discomfort, leading to fainting or even, rarely, death.
GUM_whow_chicken-37	Keep hypnosis short and infrequent.
GUM_whow_chicken-38	It's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes.
GUM_whow_chicken-39	Even if it does, the chicken shouldn't suffer as long as you let it go soon afterward.
GUM_whow_chicken-40	Hours of stress, or regular exposure to stressful situations, can cause serious health problems.
GUM_whow_chicken-41	Get your chickens used to humans and novelty.
GUM_whow_chicken-42	Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect.
GUM_whow_chicken-43	Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help.
GUM_whow_chicken-44	Hens raise in battery cages stay "hypnotized" longer, possibly because of greater fear.
GUM_whow_chicken-45	Watch for signs of stress.
GUM_whow_chicken-46	Abnormal feathering, constant preening, or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken.
GUM_whow_chicken-47	While hypnotizing is unlikely to cause serious harm, any type of stress is more damaging to a chicken in this state.
GUM_whow_elevator-1	How to Annoy People in Elevators
GUM_whow_elevator-2	An elevator is almost the perfect environment to be a prankster.
GUM_whow_elevator-3	It’s easy to annoy people when you are cramped in such a small, tight space.
GUM_whow_elevator-4	Because elevator rides usually last less than a minute, make sure your pranks are quick and have a lot of punch.
GUM_whow_elevator-5	When annoying people on an elevator, keep your pranks lighthearted and fun as opposed to mean-spirited so that everyone leaving the elevator will have a pleasant story to tell.
GUM_whow_elevator-6	Method 1 Using the Elevator to Annoy People
GUM_whow_elevator-7	Push all the buttons.
GUM_whow_elevator-8	When you get into the elevator, push the button for every floor.
GUM_whow_elevator-9	This makes everyone’s ride on the elevator longer, if only for a few seconds.
GUM_whow_elevator-10	If you want to take it a step further, look around questioningly at everyone in the elevator when no one gets off at the floors you pushed. [1]
GUM_whow_elevator-11	When someone comes in, say, "I've got this," before you push all of the buttons.
GUM_whow_elevator-12	You can also push all the buttons as you reach the floor you are getting off at.
GUM_whow_elevator-13	If someone asks you why you pushed all the buttons, you can honestly say, "It was just a joke!"
GUM_whow_elevator-14	Make a dinging noise at each floor.
GUM_whow_elevator-15	Every time the elevator reaches a new floor, say “ding!” very loudly.
GUM_whow_elevator-16	You can even sing the word “ding” on each floor like notes in a scale, getting higher as you reach each new floor. [2]
GUM_whow_elevator-17	You can make other noises if you prefer, such as a bird cawing or an explosion sound every time a button is pushed.
GUM_whow_elevator-18	Talk to your reflection in the mirror.
GUM_whow_elevator-19	Many elevators have mirrors on the walls.
GUM_whow_elevator-20	A great way to be mischievous in an elevator is to carry on a running commentary while you look at yourself in the mirror.
GUM_whow_elevator-21	You could look at yourself, turning to catch different angles and say “All right, all right, now we ’re talking,” very loudly.
GUM_whow_elevator-22	You could also keep adjusting your shirt or your hair, keeping a running dialogue about what look is best for you.
GUM_whow_elevator-23	Stand in the corner of the elevator facing the wall.
GUM_whow_elevator-24	Don't say anything the whole ride.
GUM_whow_elevator-25	Dance to the elevator music.
GUM_whow_elevator-26	Many elevators play music in the background, usually soft rock or smooth jazz.
GUM_whow_elevator-27	If you ’re in an elevator that is playing music, start to dance.
GUM_whow_elevator-28	Start just bobbing your head and tapping your feet, and then get your whole body into it.
GUM_whow_elevator-29	Take up as much space as you can to dance until everyone is staring at you. [3]
GUM_whow_elevator-30	Announce every floor.
GUM_whow_elevator-31	At every floor, make a loud announcement telling everyone the floor number.
GUM_whow_elevator-32	Say something like “Everyone going to floor ten, get off now! No time to dilly dally!” [4]
GUM_whow_elevator-33	You can also pretend to conduct people onto the elevator, saying “All aboard the elevator train!”
GUM_whow_elevator-34	Exclaim that you've lost a beast.
GUM_whow_elevator-35	When the elevator is going from the bottom floor to the top, as soon as the doors close, exclaim that you lost your tarantula / snake / scorpion but confirm that it is somewhere in the elevator.
GUM_whow_elevator-36	Most people will probably see that this is a joke.
GUM_whow_elevator-37	However, if somebody looks seriously alarmed or is starting to panic, let them know that you were not being serious.
GUM_whow_elevator-38	Build in or add something to the elevator.
GUM_whow_elevator-39	For example, build a Lego city in the middle of the elevator.
GUM_whow_elevator-40	Lay a Twister mat on the floor and ask people if they want to play.
GUM_whow_elevator-41	Talk to people.
GUM_whow_elevator-42	When there are a lot of people, say, "You 're probably wondering why I've gathered you here today."
GUM_whow_flirt-1	How to Flirt Through Instant Messaging
GUM_whow_flirt-2	So you want to flirt with a guy or gal on MSN, AIM, Facebook Chat, or any other instant messaging service and you don't want to look like a creep?
GUM_whow_flirt-3	Congratulations — by seeking help, you've already demonstrated more self-awareness than the vast majority of online flirts.
GUM_whow_flirt-4	See Step 1 below to start flirting smartly and respectfully.
GUM_whow_flirt-5	Part 1 of 2: Flirting Dos
GUM_whow_flirt-6	Start the conversation casually.
GUM_whow_flirt-7	As in the real world, the first step to flirting is to get over your cold feet and jump right in!
GUM_whow_flirt-8	Text the other person a brief message asking them about their day, asking them a specific question about work or school, or simply saying "Hi!".
GUM_whow_flirt-9	The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance, so if you 're having a hard time taking the plunge, just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes, it'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter.
GUM_whow_flirt-10	There's no reason to be nervous when it comes to IM flirting —
GUM_whow_flirt-11	if the person you want to talk to doesn't want to talk to you, s/he always has the option of simply not responding to your message, as, from your point of view, this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer.
GUM_whow_flirt-12	This being said, if you barely know someone, it can be a good idea to have an excuse for starting a conversation to avoid awkwardness.
GUM_whow_flirt-13	Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet, as is asking a question about something striking about the person.
GUM_whow_flirt-14	For instance, if the person has a band-related username, you might say: "Hey, cool name. Did you see those guys when they last came to town? "
GUM_whow_flirt-15	Start small talk.
GUM_whow_flirt-16	After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries, you'll probably want to ask how the person's doing (just like you might in the real world).
GUM_whow_flirt-17	Ask him or her about work or school, his / her interests, or any recent trips, for instance.
GUM_whow_flirt-18	Rather than asking a question, you can also simply offer your comments on these things.
GUM_whow_flirt-19	When s/he responds, add your own comments or ask follow-up questions and proceed from there!
GUM_whow_flirt-20	Don't pry into his or her personal life — keep things light, fun, and focused on worry-free subjects.
GUM_whow_flirt-21	Don't dwell too long on small talk.
GUM_whow_flirt-22	A minute or two is great for breaking the ice, but much more can get boring fast.
GUM_whow_flirt-23	For example, after we've opened up by asking about this person's interest in the band in his / her username, it's logical and reasonable to ask about this person's musical likes and dislikes.
GUM_whow_flirt-24	You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions.
GUM_whow_flirt-25	For instance, you might say something like: "If you like those guys, you might want to check out this band called Manic Albatross - they 're like the Beatles, only darker. What sorts of other bands do you like?"
GUM_whow_flirt-26	Joke.
GUM_whow_flirt-27	Everyone likes a good sense of humor.
GUM_whow_flirt-28	In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe, "If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything" (don't worry, ladies — the same is true for men!)
GUM_whow_flirt-29	Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic as you respond to the statements of the person you 're talking to.
GUM_whow_flirt-30	For instance, if you 're asked what you 're up to, rather than saying, "looking for people to hit on on Facebook" you might find that it's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like "writing the great American novel" or "drowning my sorrows".
GUM_whow_flirt-31	These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies, like the writing you 're doing on the side and the great bourbon you tasted the other day.
GUM_whow_flirt-32	In our example conversation, you might work a joke or two into your music-related small talk.
GUM_whow_flirt-33	For instance, you might say something like, "I don't know why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature. Does he even have time to record between rehab stints?"
GUM_whow_flirt-34	Part 2 of 2: Flirting Don'ts
GUM_whow_flirt-35	Don't be too self-deprecating.
GUM_whow_flirt-36	Simply put, confidence is sexy.
GUM_whow_flirt-37	This is more true for real-life situations than it is online, but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well.
GUM_whow_flirt-38	For instance, you'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense.
GUM_whow_flirt-39	Just one is plenty — it shouldn't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation.
GUM_whow_flirt-40	Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one in which you appear needy and self-loathing.
GUM_whow_flirt-41	On the other hand, this isn't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people's expense, as this can make you seem mean and petty.
GUM_whow_flirt-42	Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else don't have a place in flirtatious conversations.
GUM_whow_flirt-43	Don't be too sappy.
GUM_whow_flirt-44	People like flirting to be fun.
GUM_whow_flirt-45	For most people, receiving compliments is only fun up to a point — getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self-conscious.
GUM_whow_flirt-46	It can also make him or her question your motives, leading the person to believe that you may be trying to get something out of him or her.
GUM_whow_flirt-47	Besides, the wooing power of flowery, gushing compliments is diminished (to say the least) when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces.
GUM_whow_flirt-48	Instead of relying too heavily on compliments, instead, focus on having an engaging, genuine conversation.
GUM_whow_flirt-49	Follow the mantra "show, don't tell."
GUM_whow_flirt-50	In other words, show that you 're attracted to this person by giving him or her a great conversation, not by stating it outright.
GUM_whow_glowstick-1	How to Make a Glowstick
GUM_whow_glowstick-2	Those glowing Mountain Dew videos with peroxide and baking soda are all hoaxes.
GUM_whow_glowstick-3	To truly make a glowstick without breaking an already-made glowstick and shoving its contents into a tube (also known as cheating), you've gotta let your inner scientist out (along with a few dollars).
GUM_whow_glowstick-4	If you 're still curious, read on.
GUM_whow_glowstick-5	This is fun for anyone and everyone.
GUM_whow_glowstick-6	Method One of Two: Using Luminol
GUM_whow_glowstick-7	Put on protective glasses.
GUM_whow_glowstick-8	In addition, wear gloves to protect your skin.
GUM_whow_glowstick-9	It's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best.
GUM_whow_glowstick-10	Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected.
GUM_whow_glowstick-11	Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children!
GUM_whow_glowstick-12	Listen up, kids: You'll be working with a solution that's near a 12 on the pH scale.
GUM_whow_glowstick-13	That basically means don't swallow it, don't put it in your eyes, don't bathe in it, and don't really expose yourself to it directly at all.
GUM_whow_glowstick-14	Got it?
GUM_whow_glowstick-15	Moving on.
GUM_whow_glowstick-16	Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl.
GUM_whow_glowstick-17	A ceramic bowl will work best, but plastic works too.
GUM_whow_glowstick-18	Use funnels, measuring tubes, and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you.
GUM_whow_glowstick-19	Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol's nitrogen atoms with oxygen.
GUM_whow_glowstick-20	When that happens, all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results?
GUM_whow_glowstick-21	The glow.
GUM_whow_glowstick-22	Mix .2 grams of luminol, 4 grams of sodium carbonate, .4 grams of copper sulfate, .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of distilled water in a second bowl.
GUM_whow_glowstick-23	It is important not to touch the luminol.
GUM_whow_glowstick-24	Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy.
GUM_whow_glowstick-25	Unfortunately, these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests.
GUM_whow_glowstick-26	Yep, unless you 're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy / criminologist you probably don't have this stuff lying around the house (hopefully not ...).
GUM_whow_glowstick-27	If you 're dead set on starting your own glowstick business (worse ideas exist), try websites like Alfa Aesar [1] or Sigma Aldrich [2] for supplies.
GUM_whow_glowstick-28	Mix everything well.
GUM_whow_glowstick-29	Don't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort.
GUM_whow_glowstick-30	Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly.
GUM_whow_glowstick-31	It's important to use sanitary, clean tubes for your glowsticks.
GUM_whow_glowstick-32	The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you 're depending on to make the substances glow.
GUM_whow_glowstick-33	Set the correct lid next to each container.
GUM_whow_glowstick-34	This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling.
GUM_whow_glowstick-35	It's not like the glow will get up and run away from you, but still.
GUM_whow_glowstick-36	Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles.
GUM_whow_glowstick-37	Shake them up once the lids are on tightly.
GUM_whow_glowstick-38	Then turn off the lights!
GUM_whow_glowstick-39	If it's not already glowing, something went wrong.
GUM_whow_glowstick-40	Do over!
GUM_whow_glowstick-41	Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow.
GUM_whow_glowstick-42	Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them!
GUM_whow_glowstick-43	But act quickly ...
GUM_whow_glowstick-44	the glow won't last very long.
GUM_whow_glowstick-45	Expectations crushed?
GUM_whow_glowstick-46	Method two to the rescue!
GUM_whow_glowstick-47	The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates doesn't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes.
GUM_whow_glowstick-48	For something that lasts hours, go to the next method (which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory, but it's still worth mentioning).
GUM_whow_languages-1	Method 2 of 2: Using Grammar
GUM_whow_languages-2	Name your language.
GUM_whow_languages-3	This is the most fundamental property in all languages.
GUM_whow_languages-4	You have many names to choose from.
GUM_whow_languages-5	You can even use a made up word from your made up language like 'Victory' or 'Great Language'.
GUM_whow_languages-6	The choice is all yours.
GUM_whow_languages-7	Start off with the highly frequently used words such as 'and' or 'I' or 'one' or 'the'.
GUM_whow_languages-8	It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used.
GUM_whow_languages-9	An example would be 'ant' for and or 'es' or even 'loo' for the word 'and'.
GUM_whow_languages-10	Start thinking about the grammar rules.
GUM_whow_languages-11	For example if the word Bird is 'Vogelaviatiolap' then why not make the word Birds 'Vogelaviatiolaps' since the suffix 's' is added at the end for most languages at plurals.
GUM_whow_languages-12	If you want to add complication, you can add genders like most European languages like French and German.
GUM_whow_languages-13	For example, if you want the word 'horse' to be a boy, you may want 'the horse' to be 'Mat Fereder', but a 'cat' to be a girl, you may want, 'the cat' to be 'Fet Kamaow'.
GUM_whow_languages-14	Consider basing your language on an existing language.
GUM_whow_languages-15	For example, in my made up language, 'Vogelaviatiolap' means Bird.
GUM_whow_languages-16	If you haven't guessed, it comes from the following:
GUM_whow_languages-17	'Vogel' comes from German, which means bird
GUM_whow_languages-18	'aviatio' comes from English.
GUM_whow_languages-19	It's uncompleted though, because the word is part of the term 'aviation'
GUM_whow_languages-20	'lap' comes from Onomatopoeia.
GUM_whow_languages-21	It's a completed term, but it is supposed to come from 'Flap!'
GUM_whow_languages-22	Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented.
GUM_whow_languages-23	For example, if you invented the word 'China' as 'Khinssa', 'Drink' as 'Bever', and the word 'Accident' as 'Casnondelibreaten', why not make the word 'tea' as 'Khincasnonbever' or 'Bevernondelibreatekin' or even 'Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever'!
GUM_whow_languages-24	Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words.
GUM_whow_languages-25	Why not add some non Latin Characters such as ß?
GUM_whow_languages-26	You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese!
GUM_whow_languages-27	You can even take some words of languages, altering them or not.
GUM_whow_languages-28	You can make the word 'pen' as 'penn' or even 'pen'.
GUM_whow_languages-29	Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word.
GUM_whow_languages-30	Keep track of all your
GUM_whow_languages-31	Remember to write down your creations!
GUM_whow_languages-32	Use your language.
GUM_whow_languages-33	Get used to using it yourself, and spread it to others.
GUM_whow_languages-34	Once you feel confident about your language, experiment and expand:
GUM_whow_languages-35	Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language.
GUM_whow_languages-36	Teach your friends this new language.
GUM_whow_languages-37	As soon as your friends understand your language, communicate to them with it.
GUM_whow_languages-38	Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends, family and strangers!
GUM_whow_languages-39	Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language.
GUM_whow_languages-40	If you 're really ambitious, set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language.
GUM_whow_languages-41	One day, maybe you can make it the official language of a country!
GUM_whow_languages-42	Tips
GUM_whow_languages-43	Make sure that it is a language that while speaking, you don't get a literal knot in your tongue!
GUM_whow_languages-44	Remember you should know how to write it.
GUM_whow_languages-45	For example we write it from left to right, in Arabic it's right to left, Chinese is in columns, and so on.
GUM_whow_languages-46	Make sure that you and your friend(s) all follow a systematic language system.
GUM_whow_languages-47	In other words, make sure that you follow the same guidelines.
GUM_whow_languages-48	Don't use random letters.
GUM_whow_languages-49	It should make some sense, so that it will be easier to learn and speak with [Example: Don't use oh as e, hello as llo, and See ya as c yah).
GUM_whow_languages-50	Make sure you practice saying and spelling out many basic words in your language, English examples: is, who, when, of, why, if, what, where, can, may, etc.
GUM_whow_languages-51	When starting off, follow closely to a language you like.
GUM_whow_languages-52	This will make grammar much easier to make.
GUM_whow_languages-53	You must avoid simply copying the grammar rules, however, as this would technically turn your language into a code.
GUM_whow_languages-54	Practice your language frequently so that you don't forget it!
GUM_whow_languages-55	Don't forget punctuation!
GUM_whow_languages-56	As a shortcut, and for a bit of interesting background, add connotation to various letters, preferably vowels.
GUM_whow_languages-57	To do this, think of various words that begin with / have a lot of a certain vowel.
GUM_whow_languages-58	For example: austere, acrimony, ebullient, embolden; in this case, the vowel A might carry with it a negative meaning, whereas E would be positive.
GUM_whow_languages-59	Then, even if you forget your own words without the help of your dictionary, you could still make a good guess based on the composition of the letters.
GUM_whow_languages-60	Try not to make your words sound like utter and complete gibberish just add a little extra than our regular English language.
GUM_whow_languages-61	We don't want a knot in your tongue after speaking to your friends.
GUM_whow_languages-62	Just put marks over the letters or make up something right on the spot, you might have to take some time on this!
GUM_whow_languages-63	Basing letters on objects (pictographs) is an easy way to start a writing system.
GUM_whow_languages-64	Try this with a group of friends.
GUM_whow_languages-65	It's much more fun when there are other people that can understand your language.
GUM_whow_languages-66	Email or text your friends the language so that they won't be so confused.
GUM_whow_languages-67	When making a writing system, take a break about every five minutes and come back to it or all your letters will begin to look identical.
GUM_whow_languages-68	If you want to make other languages, you can use this language as a model and change some letters or sounds to create a different language.
GUM_whow_languages-69	This makes your first language a proto-language — a language that branches off into a family of languages.
GUM_whow_packing-1	How to Pack Your Possessions When Moving
GUM_whow_packing-2	Even if you can't wait to live in your new house, curb your enthusiasm and resist the urge to cram all your possessions any which way into boxes.
GUM_whow_packing-3	Steps
GUM_whow_packing-4	Pack one room at a time if possible, and start with items that are least often used.
GUM_whow_packing-5	Write down a list of everything you are packing, in particular if it's valuable.
GUM_whow_packing-6	Books, CDs, expensive clothes.
GUM_whow_packing-7	Also, take note of which item is in which box.
GUM_whow_packing-8	Use sturdy boxes.
GUM_whow_packing-9	Fill the box to the brim and seal the lid.
GUM_whow_packing-10	That way, you can easily stack boxes on top of one another.
GUM_whow_packing-11	Tape the bottom of the box securely so that it doesn't give way.
GUM_whow_packing-12	Never fill a box until it is so heavy that you can't lift it safely.
GUM_whow_packing-13	Spread the heavy items over a few boxes.
GUM_whow_packing-14	Balance boxes with lighter items like towels or soft toys.
GUM_whow_packing-15	Pack the lighter items on top.
GUM_whow_packing-16	Use bubble wrap or newspapers when packing fragile items.
GUM_whow_packing-17	However, newsprint may smudge so use newspaper selectively.
GUM_whow_packing-18	Clean paper can be purchased cheaply from moving supply stores.
GUM_whow_packing-19	Mark boxes.
GUM_whow_packing-20	Boxes should be marked "Fragile" and "This side up" to prevent mishandling.
GUM_whow_packing-21	Label each box clearly and which room it belongs to.
GUM_whow_packing-22	Write on the sides of the box as well.
GUM_whow_packing-23	Pack a separate box of essentials you may need for the first night at your new house.
GUM_whow_packing-24	Include items like toiletries, toilet paper, bottled water, snacks and a change of clothes in case you can not unpack everything in time.
GUM_whow_packing-25	Tips
GUM_whow_packing-26	Don't label boxes with contents if the contents are valuable.
GUM_whow_packing-27	Instead of writing "Silver Service - Fragile" you should write something that makes it sound less theft inviting while showing the fragile nature of the contents.
GUM_whow_packing-28	Example: "Mom's old dishes" instead of "Fine China"
GUM_whow_packing-29	Tape is cheap.
GUM_whow_packing-30	Use lots of it.
GUM_whow_packing-31	Close box bottoms well.
GUM_whow_packing-32	Get masking tape or packing tape and tape screws and other little things that came out of something back against it.
GUM_whow_packing-33	You'll want to find the right screw reassemble something without having to pick it out of 100 others when you get there.
GUM_whow_packing-34	Don't pack one box full of books or paperwork - you might not be able to carry it at all.
GUM_whow_packing-35	Fill it halfway with books, and fill it up with lighter stuff.
GUM_whow_packing-36	National superstores (Walmart) will let you walk the store for boxes when they are stocking the stores between 11 pm and 1 am.
GUM_whow_packing-37	You can find boxes of all sizes.
GUM_whow_packing-38	Cereal, diaper and houseware boxes are a good size and durable.
GUM_whow_packing-39	Just take a cart and roam the store.
GUM_whow_packing-40	They do check the cart as you leave so don't try to sneak anything past them.
GUM_whow_packing-41	U-haul and other nation companies offer box buy back services.
GUM_whow_packing-42	If you buy too many boxes you can return the unused for a full refund.
GUM_whow_packing-43	These boxes are also quite sturdy so you can re-use them or stash in your attic until you move again.
GUM_whow_packing-44	Some national companies even offer free shipping and handling so you can have some delivered or go to the local location.
GUM_whow_packing-45	Fill empty spaces with additional paper.
GUM_whow_packing-46	Throw away or donate junk you don't want to take to your new place.
GUM_whow_packing-47	Don't pack it again!!!
GUM_whow_packing-48	Set aside an area of the house where you can put all the packed boxes.
GUM_whow_packing-49	Use a room that isn't used every day such as the formal dining or living room.
GUM_whow_packing-50	You won't be tripping over boxes and you can have a better idea of what you have and where things are.
GUM_whow_packing-51	Pack books and heavy items into smaller boxes.
GUM_whow_packing-52	Digital Photos - use your camera to document the contents of boxes.
GUM_whow_parachute-1	How to Cope With a Double Parachute Failure
GUM_whow_parachute-2	While skydiving, it is possible (yet extremely unlikely) that both your primary and reserve parachutes will malfunction, leaving you with no method of reducing your velocity.
GUM_whow_parachute-3	In the vast majority of cases, this will not occur;
GUM_whow_parachute-4	nevertheless, in this event these coping strategies may assist.
GUM_whow_parachute-5	Steps
GUM_whow_parachute-6	Remain calm.
GUM_whow_parachute-7	This may seem obvious, but deep, even breathing (despite the rushing slipstream) and controlling your heart-rate are essential to your continued survival.
GUM_whow_parachute-8	Entreat assistance.
GUM_whow_parachute-9	If both your primary and reserve chutes have malfunctioned, signal immediately to a fellow jumper who has not yet deployed their chute, waving your arms and signalling that your own is not functional.
GUM_whow_parachute-10	If this is a solo jump, then skip to step 6.
GUM_whow_parachute-11	Prepare for deployment.
GUM_whow_parachute-12	After linking arms with your fellow jumper, you will need to hook your arms through their chest strap, or through both sides of the front of their harness, as far as you can, then grab onto your own strap.
GUM_whow_parachute-13	Deploy.
GUM_whow_parachute-14	The shock of the chute deployment will be intense.
GUM_whow_parachute-15	The G-forces will multiply your body weight, making it impossible to hold on;
GUM_whow_parachute-16	this is why hooking your arms through the harness is essential.
GUM_whow_parachute-17	It is likely that the shock will dislocate or break both your arms;
GUM_whow_parachute-18	nevertheless this is a small price to pay for your life.
GUM_whow_parachute-19	Prepare for impact.
GUM_whow_parachute-20	If your companion's canopy has successfully opened, then both your chances of survival have dramatically increased.
GUM_whow_parachute-21	With a large and slow canopy, your chances are even better.
GUM_whow_parachute-22	The canopy must be steered away from power lines and similar obstructions;
GUM_whow_parachute-23	try for a large body of water if you are confident your companion can save you from drowning.
GUM_whow_parachute-24	Alternative: Lack of companions
GUM_whow_parachute-25	If this is a solo jump, which constitutes the minority of skydivers, your only recourse is to ensure that at least one of your own chutes opens.
GUM_whow_parachute-26	In this case, the excellent advice offered by your instructors on assisting chute opening may be of assistance to you.
GUM_whow_parachute-27	If it becomes apparent that you cannot open either of your two parachutes, or that for some other reason they are fatally non-functional, then the following steps may be of some minor assistance.
GUM_whow_parachute-28	Appeal.
GUM_whow_parachute-29	If you are of a religious turn of mind, you may wish at this point to offer a prayer to a god, goddess, protective spirit or guardian angel.
GUM_whow_parachute-30	St Jude, the patron saint of Lost Causes, comes to mind.
GUM_whow_parachute-31	Objectively, this is not likely to help very much; but it may improve your emotional state.
GUM_whow_parachute-32	If you do not have any religious beliefs, or are for another reason unwilling to appeal to your patron deity, skip this step.
GUM_whow_parachute-33	Contemplate.
GUM_whow_parachute-34	As you approach the Earth at, or close to, terminal velocity, you may wish to contemplate your past existence, and the possibility of a future afterlife.
GUM_whow_parachute-35	A strategy that might prove helpful is to consider how fortunate you are that life has been good to you so far.
GUM_whow_parachute-36	Alternatively, if life has not been good to you so far, (and considering your current situation this seems more likely) consider how lucky you are that it will not be troubling you much longer.
GUM_whow_parachute-37	Expect impact.
GUM_whow_parachute-38	You are unlikely to have the time or ability to aim for a soft landing-spot, body of water, or other impact site that might improve your chances of survival.
GUM_whow_parachute-39	There is a minuscule chance that your impact will result in non-life-threatening injuries;
GUM_whow_parachute-40	if this seems incredibly far-fetched, comfort yourself that double chute failure in modern times is also extremely unlikely, and that you have already beaten worse odds.
GUM_whow_parachute-41	Tips
GUM_whow_parachute-42	Your reserve chute should have been packed by a certified rigger and is moderately less likely to fail;
GUM_whow_parachute-43	therefore, it may be helpful to focus your efforts on opening your reserve parachute.
GUM_whow_parachute-44	Some humans who have, for various reasons, become aware of their impending death, develop psychological coping strategies to deal with this;
GUM_whow_parachute-45	for instance, the Kubler-Ross phases of grief.
GUM_whow_parachute-46	Since your own death approaches far more quickly, this is unlikely to be of any use to you.
GUM_whow_parachute-47	Warnings
GUM_whow_parachute-48	Water landings: if you have successfully attached to a companion whose chute opens, keep in mind that both your arms may be broken or dislocated, and you may be unable to swim or tread water before your chute fills and drags you under.
GUM_whow_parachute-49	If, after total chute failure, you land on something soft, it is possible that instead of being killed outright, you may be permanently paralyzed due to spinal injury.
GUM_whow_parachute-50	If you have a strong aversion to this outcome, aiming head-downward before impact in the manner of an Olympic diver may ensure the destruction of your cranium and your immediate demise.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-1	How to Stop Procrastinating
GUM_whow_procrastinating-2	If you 're a chronic procrastinator, you know the pain and stress that comes with putting things off.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-3	Although you may have the desire to accomplish something, getting the motivation to do it is a different matter.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-4	Fortunately, overcoming your procrastination is easy to do when you put your mind to it.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-5	Side note: If you have anything due right now, and you haven't finished it, leave this article and complete that work.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-6	Steps
GUM_whow_procrastinating-7	Create a to-do list.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-8	Yes, make yourself an old fashioned to-do list with check boxes and everything.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-9	List everything, big and small, that you have to do for your entire day; break big activities into smaller bits if necessary.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-10	Then, as you work through your day, check off each of the items on your list.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-11	You will feel a growing sense of pride as you visually monitor your ever-diminishing list of projects.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-12	Focus your list on including the things you typically put off, not the things you are sure to do on a regular basis.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-13	If necessary, set time-frames for your items to be done by.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-14	For example, list “take the dog for a walk by 12:30” rather than simply “walk the dog.”
GUM_whow_procrastinating-15	Re-evaluate your list halfway through your day to rank your items based on highest priority.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-16	Then, tackle the most important ones before looking back at the smaller things to do.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-17	Keep a notebook by hand before you start your workday.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-18	Write every thought down that comes up during work.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-19	Every single to do or things you want to do at that specific moment.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-20	Don't do it, put it on a list and do it later.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-21	This prevents you from getting into the "procrastination zone."
GUM_whow_procrastinating-22	Finish the hard stuff.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-23	When you have a looming project that's bogging you down and making you unproductive in other areas, tackle it first.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-24	Finishing the largest item on your list of things to do will make you feel extra productive and give you the boost to do other things you’ve been pushing to the side.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-25	If your “big project” is something that can’t be done in one sitting, make a list of small parts of it that you can accomplish today.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-26	Don’t worry about completing the entire thing, but take steps now so that doing so in the future is a breeze.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-27	Make an ultimate to-do list for this single project, and have it placed somewhere you will see it on a regular basis.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-28	As you mark things off, you will be motivated to continue doing so, and seeing it on a regular basis will remind you that your project needs to be done.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-29	Do two-minute tasks.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-30	Whenever you are presented with something that you don’t want to do or would consider putting off, ask yourself, “will this take me less than two minutes to finish?”
GUM_whow_procrastinating-31	For many of us, this includes small chores, like taking out the trash or pulling a few weeds, but can include simple tasks in all areas of life.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-32	Anything that you want to put off but takes two minutes to do - do it.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-33	Simply force yourself to use the next 120 seconds to be productive and do the duty you normally would push off for hours or days. [1].
GUM_whow_procrastinating-34	Create a timed work frenzy.

GUM_whow_procrastinating-38	Chances are, you’ll get into a groove and keep working at a high pace even when your frenzy time is out.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-39	Working with a timer is generally regarded by most experts as being one of the best ways to develop self-discipline and stop procrastination.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-40	The most famous method of working to strict time controls (known as time-boxing) involves creating a list of tasks.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-41	Each task is then assigned an exact amount of time to complete.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-42	If you don't finish the task in the allotted time, then you move on to the next one.
GUM_whow_procrastinating-43	Using this work arrangement, it forces you to take action, as you can't afford to waste any time. [2].
GUM_whow_procrastinating-44	Give yourself a break.

GUM_whow_quidditch-1	How to Play Muggle Quidditch
GUM_whow_quidditch-2	In the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling the main wizarding sport is Quidditch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-3	However you don't have to have magical powers to play.
GUM_whow_quidditch-4	There are many different ways of playing Quidditch, but the most commonly used set of rules are those given by the International Quidditch Association (which can be found here).
GUM_whow_quidditch-5	In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US, but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams.
GUM_whow_quidditch-6	Quidditch has also spread outside of America and is now played on 5 continents.
GUM_whow_quidditch-7	Steps
GUM_whow_quidditch-8	Gather all needed materials and players (see Things You'll Need section below).
GUM_whow_quidditch-9	Know that all players can play while riding a broom.
GUM_whow_quidditch-10	Brooms can be a hindrance however, so feel free to not use brooms.
GUM_whow_quidditch-11	Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field.
GUM_whow_quidditch-12	Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-13	Start the game.
GUM_whow_quidditch-14	Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers.
GUM_whow_quidditch-15	Follow your duty depending what type of player you are:
GUM_whow_quidditch-16	Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops.
GUM_whow_quidditch-17	Each score is worth 10 points.
GUM_whow_quidditch-18	Beaters try to peg players with their bludger.
GUM_whow_quidditch-19	If a player is pegged they have to stop what they 're doing and pay a penalty; i.e. (drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds.
GUM_whow_quidditch-20	Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers' attempts at scoring.
GUM_whow_quidditch-21	If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers.
GUM_whow_quidditch-22	Seekers try to tackle the snitch (a person) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag.
GUM_whow_quidditch-23	You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-24	A common way to play is to make the snitch a person, and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries.
GUM_whow_quidditch-25	Then the seekers search for the snitch, and attempt to tag the player.
GUM_whow_quidditch-26	Other methods, such as the method adopted in 2005, makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock, hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner.
GUM_whow_quidditch-27	Regardless of method, the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team, unlike the books, in which the snitch is worth 150 points.
GUM_whow_quidditch-28	The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-29	The snitch, generally a track runner, runs around (usually the boundaries) trying to evade the seekers.
GUM_whow_quidditch-30	The referee should ensure that rules are being followed.
GUM_whow_quidditch-31	They also keep track of the score.
GUM_whow_quidditch-32	Play the game!
GUM_whow_quidditch-33	The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-34	Feel free to alter the game rules.
GUM_whow_quidditch-35	See the Tips section for suggestions.

GUM_whow_quidditch-37	How to Play a Real-Life Game of Quidditch
GUM_whow_quidditch-38	You don't need flying broomsticks or magic balls to play this version of the game - it's tailor-made for muggles like us.
GUM_whow_quidditch-39	This video shows a more realistic approach to playing Quidditch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-40	Tips
GUM_whow_quidditch-41	Alternatively the snitch can be a small yellow ball (tennis balls work great) that is hidden before the game starts by a bystander or referee.
GUM_whow_quidditch-42	Establish boundaries and have the seekers look for the snitch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-43	Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat.
GUM_whow_quidditch-44	They could also use regular-length hockey sticks to hit bludgers (perhaps wiffle balls) on the ground.
GUM_whow_quidditch-45	The simplest way is to just peg players by throwing dodge balls.
GUM_whow_quidditch-46	It may be easier to play without brooms (but also less fun!).
GUM_whow_quidditch-47	Remember that the snitch runner, if you choose to use one, is not an actual player in the game, therefore, not bound by any of the rules.
GUM_whow_quidditch-48	If desired, the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants to avoid capture.
GUM_whow_quidditch-49	See How to Be a Snitch in Quidditch for more information.
GUM_whow_quidditch-50	You can play water quidditch in a pool.
GUM_whow_quidditch-51	Almost all the same rules apply.
GUM_whow_quidditch-52	Have someone throw something (the snitch) on a line into the pool at regular intervals.
GUM_whow_quidditch-53	They can even use fake snitches.
GUM_whow_quidditch-54	You can buy authentic looking brooms to make the game more realistic.
GUM_whow_quidditch-55	There is a very large Quidditch community, have a look at the IQA website to find teams near you.
GUM_whow_quidditch-56	One variation is Quarter Snitch Quidditch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-57	Find a quarter or another small coin.
GUM_whow_quidditch-58	Have both of the teams turn around and have the referee throw it into the grass or pitch while the teams aren't looking.
GUM_whow_quidditch-59	Play while the seekers look for the snitch.
GUM_whow_quidditch-60	Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field (in this case it's a small ball).
GUM_whow_quidditch-61	The seeker has to find the snitch blindfolded, relying only on the coach's instructions, while the game is still on.
GUM_whow_quidditch-62	Warnings
GUM_whow_quidditch-63	Stay hydrated and exercise wisely.
GUM_whow_quidditch-64	A ball flying in the air can hurt.
GUM_whow_quidditch-65	If you 're playing quidditch you 're probably just having fun so play nicely.

GUM_whow_quinoa-1	How to Prepare Quinoa
GUM_whow_quinoa-2	Quinoa is known as the little rice of Peru.
GUM_whow_quinoa-3	The Incas treated the crop as sacred and referred to quinoa as "chisaya mama" or "mother of all grains." [1]
GUM_whow_quinoa-4	By tradition, the Inca emperor would sow the first seeds of the season using "golden implements."
GUM_whow_quinoa-5	Quinoa is rich in protein and much lighter than other grains.
GUM_whow_quinoa-6	It is much easier to prepare than rice and is rapidly gaining in popularity, especially among vegetarians who value its high protein levels.
GUM_whow_quinoa-7	Ingredients
GUM_whow_quinoa-8	1 cup quinoa
GUM_whow_quinoa-9	2 cups water (or broth)
GUM_whow_quinoa-10	Olive oil to taste (Optional)
GUM_whow_quinoa-11	1/2 teaspoon salt (Optional)
GUM_whow_quinoa-12	Method 1 Cooking On A Stove Top
GUM_whow_quinoa-13	Rinse the grains of quinoa in water.
GUM_whow_quinoa-14	You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box.
GUM_whow_quinoa-15	To rinse, place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes.
GUM_whow_quinoa-16	This is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed.
GUM_whow_quinoa-17	Toast quinoa in a saucepan (optional).
GUM_whow_quinoa-18	Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
GUM_whow_quinoa-19	Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute.
GUM_whow_quinoa-20	This brings out quinoa's nutty flavor.
GUM_whow_quinoa-21	Cook the quinoa.
GUM_whow_quinoa-22	Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.
GUM_whow_quinoa-23	Cover and reduce heat to low.
GUM_whow_quinoa-24	Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain.
GUM_whow_quinoa-25	Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ, in the same way as pasta.
GUM_whow_quinoa-26	Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat.
GUM_whow_quinoa-27	Take the quinoa off the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
GUM_whow_quinoa-28	This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan.
GUM_whow_quinoa-29	Uncover and fluff with a fork.
GUM_whow_quinoa-30	The quinoa should look light and fluffy, and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed.
GUM_whow_quinoa-31	Serve.
GUM_whow_quinoa-32	Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor.
GUM_whow_quinoa-33	Serve with:
GUM_whow_quinoa-34	Stir-fry, using the quinoa as a substitute for rice.
GUM_whow_quinoa-35	Curry.
GUM_whow_quinoa-36	Braised meat.
GUM_whow_quinoa-37	In a salad.
GUM_whow_quinoa-38	Virtually any other combination you can think of!
GUM_whow_quinoa-39	Method 2 Cooking In a Rice Cooker
GUM_whow_quinoa-40	Rinse 1 cup of quinoa in a fine mesh sieve under cold water.
GUM_whow_quinoa-41	If you bought packaged quinoa, this step isn't always necessary, but it's better to be safe than sorry.
GUM_whow_quinoa-42	Pour quinoa into rice cooker.
GUM_whow_quinoa-43	One option is to toast the quinoa before placing in the rice cooker.
GUM_whow_quinoa-44	See Step # 2 in Method One above for directions.
GUM_whow_quinoa-45	Add 2 cups of liquid and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the rice cooker.
GUM_whow_quinoa-46	Water, chicken stock or broth, or vegetable stock all work.
GUM_whow_quinoa-47	Cook for approximately 15 minutes.
GUM_whow_quinoa-48	Some rice cooker will have different settings instead of a simple "cook" option.
GUM_whow_quinoa-49	Try the "white rice" option if your rice cooker gives you several options.
GUM_whow_quinoa-50	Let stand for about 5 minutes.
GUM_whow_quinoa-51	Fluff with a fork and serve.
GUM_whow_quinoa-52	Method 3 Cooking In the Oven
GUM_whow_quinoa-53	Preheat oven to 350 ° F (177 ° C).
GUM_whow_quinoa-54	Arrange rack in the middle of the oven.
GUM_whow_quinoa-55	Rinse quinoa thoroughly in a fine mesh seive under cold water.
GUM_whow_quinoa-56	In a medium saucepan, heat up 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-low heat.
GUM_whow_quinoa-57	Add onions, peppers, mushrooms, or any other type of desired vegetable or herb into the saucepan (optional).
GUM_whow_quinoa-58	Cook onions until they are translucent, but not burned.
GUM_whow_quinoa-59	Sweat the peppers or vegetables along with the onions.
GUM_whow_quinoa-60	Add the quinoa and salt to the saucepan, stirring until completely incorporated.
GUM_whow_quinoa-61	This should take no longer than 30 seconds.
GUM_whow_quinoa-62	Add one cup of broth and one cup of water to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat.
GUM_whow_quinoa-63	Once a boil is reached, transfer quinoa to a 8-by-8-inch baking dish. [2]
GUM_whow_quinoa-64	Spread out quinoa evenly and cover baking dish completely with aluminum foil.
GUM_whow_quinoa-65	Cook the quinoa in the oven for roughly 20 minutes, or until most of the liquid is gone.
GUM_whow_quinoa-66	Remove the aluminum foil from the baking dish, add cheese or other seasonings, and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
GUM_whow_quinoa-67	After 5 minutes, the quinoa should be fully cooked.
GUM_whow_quinoa-68	Serve and enjoy!
