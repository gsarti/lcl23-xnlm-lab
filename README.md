# XNLM Lab @ LCL 2023 üîç

This repository contains materials for the lab *"Explaining Neural Language Models from Internal Representations to Model Predictions"* by [Alessio Miaschi](https://alemiaschi.github.io/) and [Gabriele Sarti](https://gsarti.com/) at the [AILC Lectures on Computational Linguistics 2023](https://www.ai-lc.it/en/lectures-2/lectures-2023/).

## Contents

The lab session is divided in two parts:

- Notebooks [1.1](notebooks/1.1_Transformer_Syntactic_Abilities.ipynb) and [1.2](notebooks/1.2_Probing.ipynb) introduce probing approaches for evaluating the linguistic knowledge of neural language models and shows how diagnostic classifiers can be used to study  models' internal representations.

- Notebook [2](notebooks/2_Attribution_Contrastive.ipynb) discusses feature attribution methods and their usage to identify biases and prediction errors in NLMs for classification and generation tasks.

You can find a notebook for each part in the [`notebooks`](notebooks/) folder.

## Tools and Frameworks

The lab sessions make use of the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) environment. You can use the following links to get started:

- [Jupyter Notebook/Lab Installation](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Jupyter Quickstart](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html)

Alternatively, it is possible to use the notebooks via the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) web environment simply by clicking on the [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]() button at the beginning of each notebook. If you‚Äôre running on Windows, we recommend following along using a Colab notebook. If you‚Äôre using a Linux distribution or macOS, you can use either approach described here. For an intro to the Colab environment, refer to:

- [Colab Quickstart](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)


The file `requirements.txt` in this repository contains the list of all the packages required to run the lab sessions. You can create a Python virtual environment (Python>=3.8.1) and install them using the following command:


```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the virtual environment is activated before running Jupyter. If you are using Colab, simply run the cell at the beginning of each notebook to install the required packages. Refer to [Using a Python Virtual Environment](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/1#using-a-python-virtual-environment) for more details on how to create and activate a virtual environment.
